The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, Pastor Enoch Adeboye has broken silence on the rape allegation leveled against Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo of the Commonwealth of Zion Assembly, COZA. Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo is being accused by singer Timi Dakolo’s wife, Busola Dakolo, of raping her multiple times when she was just 17. Adeboye who spoke during a service at the Redemption Camp, stated that he doesn’t have much to say other than what the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, and the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, PFN, have said. “I don’t want to comment on some happenings… Like I’ve always told you when people say ‘why don’t you talk?’. I say I’m under authority. The Redeemed Christian Church of God belongs to CAN and we belong to PFN. And in CAN we have a president, in PFN we have a president. Whatever they say, that’s what I’ve said. That’s why I kept my mouth shut”, he said. Since the news broke out, many Nigerians including notable pastors have aired their opinions and also called for an investigation to be carried out to ascertain the truth of the matter that allegedly happened 20 years ago. Pastor Adeboye also had a word of advice for aspiring ministers of God. According to him, there’s nothing hidden that shall not come to the open. He went on to warn them that their sins will surely find them. Speaking further, the man of God warned the aspiring ministers to flee from youthful lust and evil. “When you see a sister smiling at you in a koi koi way, run. Run as in terror. Don’t say, ‘nah, I’m a great man of God, I’m highly anointed’. Ask Samson”, he said.(NAN)
