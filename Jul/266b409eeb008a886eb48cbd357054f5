He said Nigerian professionals were invited from all over the world to contribute their quota to the country since HYPREP, which was supposed to embody responsive business activity was to be the first environmental clean-up in Nigeria. Ilamah pointed out Â that two of the staff died in active service in 2013 without compensation till date, adding that the directive by the president that the outstanding salaries be paid following the adoption of the recommendations of the Inter-Ministerial Ad-hoc Committee (he (Buhari) ordered to be set up to sort out the salaries issue) has not been complied with.
