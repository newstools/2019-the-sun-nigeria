Uche Usim, Abuja and Adewale Sanyaolu As part of efforts to grow local refining capacity, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) is seeking collaboration with Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL) to establish a condensate splinter refinery. Its NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, disclosed this when the management of Chevron CNL led by its Managing Director, Jeff Ewing, paid a business visit to the NNPC Towers, Abuja. The GMD was quoted as saying that setting up refineries to end the shame of fuel importation was not just a responsibility for NNPC alone, but also for its Joint Venture partners. The GMD also urged CNL to work closely with the corporation to evolve modalities for a downward review of the cost structure of crude oil production in order to boost profit and revenue for the country. “We hold Chevron Nigeria Limited (CNL) in a very high esteem for her efficiency and cost optimization. We look more up to the company to increase production and reserve, reduce cost and increase local refining capacity”, Kyari stated.
