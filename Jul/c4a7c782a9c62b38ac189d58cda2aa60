Two health workers engaged in prevention of Ebola disease were killed in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) the Health Ministry said on Monday. The two people, who had been engaged in the fight against the outbreak of the deadly disease, were killed at their homes in North Kivu province. According to the ministry, the health workers were killed after months of threats. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recently expressed concern that the spread of Ebola in the DRC had escalated in the past few months, with more than 2,000 cases recorded since the epidemic broke out again. The current outbreak is the worst on record after the epidemic struck mainly Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone between 2014 and 2016, leaving more than 11,300 people dead.
