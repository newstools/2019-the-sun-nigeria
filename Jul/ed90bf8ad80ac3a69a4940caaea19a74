So, the number of Nigerian-Canadians of Igbo descent has increase,” he said.  “When diverse cultures cohabit with respect for one another, each one enriches itself as they learn from one another. Nothing is more important to people than being able to be themselves, practise their culture and language wherever they have found a home. As the Igbo people of Saskatchewan, we are very appreciative of this act by our government, a strong message that this province is home to all of us,” Dr. Igwe said.  “We invite everyone to join us for a celebration of culture, a taste of Igbo cuisine, artistic displays, dance and performances,” Dr. added.  “In the same manner, two weeks ago, in what is the first proclamation of Igbo Day of Arts and Culture by a municipal government in Canada, Mayor Michael Fougere and the City of Regina designated August 3 as Igbo Day and encouraged the residents of the Queen City (as Regina is known locally) to dedicate this day for the celebration of culture with the Igbo community of Saskatchewan.  “Please click on the following link to read the official proclamation by His Worship Mayor Michael Fougere of Regina:https://www.icassask.ca/images/pdf/proclamation-regina-2019.pdf.”  “For more information about Igbo Day and the Igbo Cultural Association of Saskatchewan, please visit https://www.icassask.ca/.”  function insertAfter(e,t){t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t.nextSibling)}function getElementByXPath(e,t){if(!t)t=document;if(t.evaluate)return t.evaluate(e,document,null,9,null).singleNodeValue;while(e.charAt(0)=="/")e=e.substr(1);var n=t;var r=e.split("/");for(var i=0;i<r.length;i++){var a=r[i].split(/(\w*)\[(\d*)\]/gi).filter(function(e){return!(e==""||e.match(/\s/gi))},this);var l=a[0];var o=a[1]?a[1]-1:0;if(i<r.length-1)n=n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o];else return n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o]}}if(!Array.prototype.filter){Array.prototype.filter=function(e){var t=this.length>>>0;if(typeof e!="function"){throw new TypeError}var n=[];var r=arguments[1];for(var i=0;i<t;i++){if(i in this){var a=this[i];if(e.call(r,a,i,this)){n.push(a)}}}return n}}function injectWidgetByXpath(e){var t=getElementByXPath(e);if(t==null){t=document.getElementById("tbdefault")}innerInject(t)}function injectWidgetByMarker(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);innerInject(t.parentNode)}function innerInject(e){var t=document.createElement("span");var n=document.createElement("script");var r="if JS crashes here, the first innerHTML value should be enclosed with single quotes instead of double, go to the minified version and change it";t.innerHTML="<div id='taboola-below-article'></div><div id='taboola-below-article-second'></div>";n.innerHTML="window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-c', container:'taboola-below-article', placement:'below-article', target_type: 'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-d', container:'taboola-below-article-second', placement:'below-article-2nd', target_type: 'mix'});";insertAfter(t,e);insertAfter(n,t)}injectWidgetByMarker('tbmarker');
