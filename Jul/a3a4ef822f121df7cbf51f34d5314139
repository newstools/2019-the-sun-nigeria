Tony John, Port Harcourt Seven family members, including husband and wife, have been found dead in Elele in Ikwerre Local Government Area of Rivers State. Daily Sun gathered that the tragic incident occurred in their apartment within an estate known as ‘Too Much Money’ in the town. One of the victims’ neighbours who confirmed the incident via the telephone, said they woke up in the morning of yesterday and noticed that the neighbour’s house was still locked.

According to the source, neighbours within the estate said they saw the man the last time when he was trying to put on his generator set, which they suspected might be the cause of their death.
