The Chinese government is considering US decision to abolish 25-percent duties on 110 imported Chinese goods as a common practice and, for its part, has already established an appropriate mechanism for some U.S. goods to be exempted from duties, the spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, Gao Feng, said at a press briefing on Thursday. On Tuesday, the U.S. announced the decision to exempt 110 imported Chinese goods from 25-per cent tariffs placed on certain Chinese goods that went into effect one year ago. “This is the usual tariff practice of the U.S. side. “The Chinese side has already established an appropriate duty exemption mechanism, and further measures will be taken in accordance with the enterprises’ request,” Gao said. The news comes after U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, reached an agreement at the G20 summit in Japan to resume trade talks, saying that new tariffs he had threatened to impose on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods would not go forward at the present time. The U.S. and China have been trying to overcome disagreements that emerged in the wake of Trump’s decision last June to impose 25 per cent tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods in a bid to fix the trade deficit.
