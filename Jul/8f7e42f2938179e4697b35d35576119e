Speaker of Edo State House of Assembly, Frank Okiye, has called on the House of Representatives not to be used by anyone to achieve a personal agenda. Speaker Okiye said the Assembly was duly inaugurated on June 17 and since then, the business of law-making has been going on, without hinderance. He said: “May I state that apart from the fact that the Edo Assembly complied with the Constitution, in the inauguration of the House, there also exists a court order with suit number FHC/B/CS/70/2019, FHC/B/M/285/2019, ordering the National Working Committee of the All Progressives Congress, Inspector General of Police, the Commissioner of Police in Edo State, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, all defendants, their servants and agents, not to interfere, disrupt or obstruct the constitutional duties of members of Edo House of Assembly. “We welcome the decision of the House of Representatives to investigate all the issues surrounding the inauguration of Edo House of Assembly. We are confident that they would not find anything contrary to the provisions of the Constitution. We humbly advise them to be guided and not get involved in petty politics; to fan the ego of an aspiring godfather.”
