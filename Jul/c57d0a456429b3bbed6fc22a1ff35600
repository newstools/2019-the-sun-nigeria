She also gave special commendation to CSP Abubakar Yakubu for not only providing a working constitution for his people, but for his charismatic leadership, which was responsible for the fast growth of Kickboxing in the country, and the return of the sport to the National Sports Festival (NSF) holding in Benin, Edo State next year.
