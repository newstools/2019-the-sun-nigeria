He added: “I commiserate with the Nigerian Union of Journalists, Nigerian Guild of Editors and sports journalists around the globe for the loss of one of their own. “Those of us who followed his career progression will not forget in a hurry how he used his expertise to shape sports journalism at the NTA, Ibadan, the first television station in Africa and at the network stations of the NTA. To say the least, sports journalism has lost a gem. “While we pray that the good Lord should condole his immediate family and give his colleagues, the sporting world and journalism in general, the fortitude to bear this great loss, we equally urge the widow, the children and members of the immediate family to remain strong in their determination to actualise the unfulfilled dreams of the departed.”
