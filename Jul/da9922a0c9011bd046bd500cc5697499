Abuja is the capital city of Nigeria, sitting magnificently in the middle of the country. The skyline of the city which was built largely in the 1980s is dominated by Aso Rock, an enormous monolith. It rises up behind the Presidential Complex, which houses the residence and offices of the Nigerian president in the Three Arms Zone on the eastern edge of the city. Nearby are the National Assembly and the Supreme Court of Nigeria. However, with so much beauty, attractiveness and glamour, our dear Abuja is perceived by many to be expensive and extremely made for the crème dela crème of the society. This allegation however, cannot be totally disregarded as the housing deficit in our almighty nation’s capital is on the increase. It is an undisputed fact that Abuja is one of the best cities to reside in Nigeria as it pride itself with some serene areas as well as well planned out roads and structures. Apart from being the nation’s capital where people can easily connect with influential people in the country, the city also has structure and buildings that many (within or outside the country) desire to acquire or live in. Putting that in mind, this article thereby creates a detailed list of the best residential estates in Nigeria’s capital.
