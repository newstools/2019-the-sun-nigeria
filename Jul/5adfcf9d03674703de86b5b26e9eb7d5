A 21-year-old Chinese man has been reunited with his biological family after almost two decades when police decided to use FaceApp-style technology to predict his present appearance. The man, Yu Weifeng, was abducted 18 years ago in 2001 from a construction site where his biological father used to work as a foreman, After sorting through nearly 100 potential candidates, officers narrowed them down to 21-year-old Weifang – a student school in China’s Guangzhou province. Investigator Zheng Zhenhai said: “When he found him, he refused to believe that he was a kidnapped child, but DNA confirmed that he was a match with his biological parents.” Weifang, whose adoptive parents named Li, went missing in 2001 near a construction site where his father worked. His parents filed a missing person report and the incident was treated as a kidnapping case.
