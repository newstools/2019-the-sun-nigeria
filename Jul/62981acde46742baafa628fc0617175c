Chinwendu Obienyi Union Bank of Nigeria (UBN) Plc has reported a profit of N12.1 billion in its half year unaudited financial statements.

However, Union Bank’s gross earnings declined by 9 per cent to N76 billion, from N83.3 billion in 2018. Interest income slipped by 8 per cent to N57.3 billion from N62.2 billion, while non-interest income depreciated by 12 per cent to N19 billion from N21.1 billion in 2018 due to muted volatility negatively impacting trading income, despite a 27 per cent growth in credit-related fees and 169 per cent growth in cash recoveries at N5.3 billion when compared with N1.9 billion recorded in 2018. Commenting on the results, its Chief Executive Officer, Emeka Emuwa, noted that in spite of the realities of operating in a challenging economic environment, the Group was able to sustain growth , adding that the bank remains steadfast in its commitment to delivering value and first-class customer experience to all its customers.
