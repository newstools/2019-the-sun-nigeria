Where will a poor family get sum of N700million for the release of their mother and others?,” our source queried. “Samson (Siasia) is said to be out of the country sorting out other issues. It’s really sad tale. These people should have mercy on the family and release the old women and the little girl.” It was further gathered that Madam Siasia complained bitterly about ordeal when the gunmen contacted the family, urging them to ensure her release in good time.
