For budding movie producer, talent manager and CEO, Undaground Media Limited, Daniel Cole, his major focus as a producer is to change the face of movie production and art of story telling in the entertainment industry. According to him, he will do this through productions that will suit international standard. “The movie industry in the last few years has done a lot of commendable jobs, but there is still room for improvement that can make us compete with other countries through investment in the state-of-the-art equipment and in-depth script writing to mention a few,” he said. As a producer, Cole  played a major role in the success story of Achievas Entertainment’s first major blockbuster, Knocking On Heavens Door, which was the first Netflix Nollywood content acquisition, through Iroko TV in 2015.
