Algeria have reached the final of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) after beating Nigeria’s Super Eagles in the semifinal on Sunday.

The Super Eagles went behind five minutes to halftime when defender Williams Troost-Ekong deflected a cross from Mahrez into his own net. Nigeria kept up the pressure as they sought an equaliser in the second half, with Algeria missing several chances to double their lead. The equaliser finally came in the 72nd minute from the penalty spot, as Odion Ighalo benefited from a VAR-awarded penalty. Meanwhile, a Dylan Bronn own goal inside 10 minutes of added time saw Senegal book their first Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) final slot in 17 years after beating Tunisia’s Carthage Eagles 1-0 in a drama-filled match at the June 30 Stadium in Cairo on Sunday night. A fully contested tie saw the two sides miss a penalty each late in the second half, eight minutes apart. Tunisia had the first after 72 minutes which Ferjani Sassi missed while Senegal had their own in the 80th minute, missed by Henri Saivet. Algeria will battle Senegal in the final while Nigeria will keep a date Tunisia in the losers final.
