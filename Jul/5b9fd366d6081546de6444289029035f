In another development, the Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi has inaugurated the committee recently constituted by his administration for the purpose of maintaining public safety and public order in the supply and distribution of petroleum products in the state. The committee was constituted following an Executive Order issued by the governor temporarily prohibiting the activities of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) in the state, as a result of the protracted crisis between warring factions of the IPMAN that has given rise to cult activities, gun battles, banditry, threat to public order and human lives and property. Inaugurating the committee at the Government House, Enugu, Gov. Ugwuanyi stated that the Executive Order – Activities of Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (Enugu State Interim Prohibition) Order 2019 – was made without prejudice to the issue in contention between the parties, their rights, and obligations and without prejudice to any judicial decision in that regard. The governor reiterated that the sole mandate of the committee, comprising representatives of the Enugu State Command of the Nigeria Police, SP Pius Eziubochi Ugwuala, who serves as the Chairman; Directorate of State Services, Uche Oko; Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps, Collins Akalawu; the Department of Petroleum Resources, Enugu Zonal Office, Alhaji Gwaram L. Ahmed; the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Anene Ojinta and the Permanent Secretary, Inter-Ministerial and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Enugu State, Mrs. Mabel Agbo, “is to maintain public order in the supply and distribution of petroleum products in the state during the pendency of the Executive Order”. While congratulating the members of the committee for “being found worthy of this onerous task,” Gov Ugwuanyi expressed the expectation of his administration and the people of the state that their competencies, experiences, and strength of character would be brought to bear on the assignment. Responding on behalf of other members of the committee, the chairman, SP Ugwuala, thanked the governor for giving them the opportunity to serve the state and promised that they would discharge their responsibility with dedication and passion. He prayed to God to grant them the wisdom and grace to succeed, reassuring the governor that they would not disappoint the government and people of Enugu State.
