He solicited the support of the people morally and through constructive criticism in order to move the government and the state forward.

I view my re-election as a challenge to work harder for the greater good of the people of Plateau State. “To my fellow elected representatives, our election comes with a measure of expectation and responsibility. I urge us to work as one to uplift the living standard of our people. If at the end of our tenures, we are unable to bring smiles to our people, we will be considered to have failed. “My appeal to the people of Plateau State is for them to correct our steps when you see that we are going off track. Our doors will be permanently open for those willing to offer us advice and even positive criticism.” The Director General of Industrial Training Fund (ITF), Joseph Ari said Shendam Quan’pan and Mikang Federal Constituency was the only zone that the All Progressives Congress (APC) won election overwhelmingly in the state.

Ari called on Plateau people to give adequate support to President Muhammadu Buhari and Governor Simon Lalong to succeed in providing the desire dividends of democracy to Nigerians.
