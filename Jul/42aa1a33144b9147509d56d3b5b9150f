Paul Osuyi, Asaba A Delta State High Court sitting at Kwale in Ndokwa West Local Government Area of the state has just nullified the national convention of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA). The claimants in the suit sought the nullification of the May 14, 2019 National Executive Committee (NEC) held at the Governor’s Lodge, Awka, Anambra State, where far reaching decisions, including the May 31 National Convention, where Mr Victor Oye was re-elected National Chairman, were made. The said NEC meeting purportedly excluded members of the party’s Board of Trustees (BoT), a party organ that was dissolved at the NEC meeting with about one month to the end of tenure for the BoT members. The court granted the prayers of the plaintiffs and nullified the May 14 NEC meeting and the subsequent actions as a result of the said meeting.
