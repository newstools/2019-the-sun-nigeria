First is the disclosure of material contributions received from individuals and corporate bodies three months after the announcement of the results of the General Election as provided for in Sec. 93(4) of the Electoral Act. “So far, no political party has complied. Secondly, parties are required to submit audited returns of their election expenses within six months after an election as provided for in Sec. 92(3)(a) of the Electoral Act. “Although we are still within the time frame provided by law, so far only one party has filed its returns. “Similarly, the Commission notes that only one presidential candidate has submitted financial expenses report. We wish to remind leaders of political parties of their obligations under the law.
