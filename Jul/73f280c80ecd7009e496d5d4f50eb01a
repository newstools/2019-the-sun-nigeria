According to the facts sheets emanating from the 77 election petition tribunals setup by the President of the Court of Appeal as at April 23, 2019, 65 petitions were either dismissed or struck out while 735 petitions are pending. In order to meet up with these targets, Justice Bulkachuwa directed the “presiding justices of the various divisions to draw up a roaster in consultation with her to allow the justices with medical appointments or other pressing family issues travel for not more than 15 days within the period. She added that the roaster that would be drawn should be arranged in such a manner that at any given time, there would be a three-member panel on ground in every division to hear and determine appeals. In divisions with three justices, only one Justice can travel at a time and the office of the President of the Court of Appeal, is to be immediately notified to form a panel in that justice’s absence should the need arise the circular further directed.
