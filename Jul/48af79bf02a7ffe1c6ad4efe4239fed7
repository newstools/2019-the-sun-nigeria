Prof. Anya who was the former chairman, Nigeria Merit Award and for 15 years Chairman, Zik Prize for Leadership, said that the fabric of the Nigerian society has been deeply shaken and could be shattered, if urgent actions were not taken, hence the urgent wisdom of a fundamental intervention aimed at raising high quality leaders.
