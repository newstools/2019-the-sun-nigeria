WOLE BALOGUN, Ado Ekiti Three civil servants abducted by suspected herders along Ayede – Isan Ekiti road last Friday in Ekiti State have regained their freedom. The workers, led by one Ayoola Alabi and two other junior staff are employees of the Ekiti State Road Maintenance Agency (EKROMA). A family source told journalists in Ado Ekiti on Friday that the captives paid the sum of N1 million ransom each to secure their freedom. The abductors had earlier demanded the sum of N10m as ransom for the release of the trio. The source said: “Yes, they were released yesterday after they paid N1m each.” The Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti Command, DSP Caleb Ikechukwu, confirmed the release. He, however, said the abductees were freed through the prompt and decisive actions taken by the police. “Immediately we heard about the kidnapping, our men bombarded the forest located between Ayede and Isan up to Ijesamodu where they were taken to. “We combed everywhere and when they knew we were closing in on them, they quickly released those they held hostage and fled. “Our men were very careful to avoid crossfire with the abductors so that the hostages won’t be killed in the process and it worked out,” he said. Ikechukwu said the police were never told whether the families paid ransom to anyone. “I can’t confirm whether ransom was paid, because we were not told and there was no need for that with the level of strategies that we deployed.” function insertAfter(e,t){t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t.nextSibling)}function getElementByXPath(e,t){if(!t)t=document;if(t.evaluate)return t.evaluate(e,document,null,9,null).singleNodeValue;while(e.charAt(0)=="/")e=e.substr(1);var n=t;var r=e.split("/");for(var i=0;i<r.length;i++){var a=r[i].split(/(\w*)\[(\d*)\]/gi).filter(function(e){return!(e==""||e.match(/\s/gi))},this);var l=a[0];var o=a[1]?a[1]-1:0;if(i<r.length-1)n=n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o];else return n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o]}}if(!Array.prototype.filter){Array.prototype.filter=function(e){var t=this.length>>>0;if(typeof e!="function"){throw new TypeError}var n=[];var r=arguments[1];for(var i=0;i<t;i++){if(i in this){var a=this[i];if(e.call(r,a,i,this)){n.push(a)}}}return n}}function injectWidgetByXpath(e){var t=getElementByXPath(e);if(t==null){t=document.getElementById("tbdefault")}innerInject(t)}function injectWidgetByMarker(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);innerInject(t.parentNode)}function innerInject(e){var t=document.createElement("span");var n=document.createElement("script");var r="if JS crashes here, the first innerHTML value should be enclosed with single quotes instead of double, go to the minified version and change it";t.innerHTML="<div id='taboola-below-article'></div><div id='taboola-below-article-second'></div>";n.innerHTML="window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-c', container:'taboola-below-article', placement:'below-article', target_type: 'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-d', container:'taboola-below-article-second', placement:'below-article-2nd', target_type: 'mix'});";insertAfter(t,e);insertAfter(n,t)}injectWidgetByMarker('tbmarker');
