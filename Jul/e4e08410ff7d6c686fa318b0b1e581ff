She said that the country was getting there, even though there are still challenges. Very soon we will have smart city, smart energy and the issue of power failure will be a thing of the past. Experts are springing up day in day out. The young ones are developing already. Our youths that are innovating need the platform to be able to sell their innovation. This will hasten the process of digitalisation,” Uduma said. The ICT expert said that her aspiration was to make sure that Nigeria becomes one of those countries participating in Internet Governance.
