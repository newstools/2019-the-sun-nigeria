Deputy National Chairman (South) of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Chief Uchenna Okogbuo  said there is nothing exciting about the new ministerial nominees. He said most of them were people who have failed in both their private and public capacities. “I have deep reservation on the ministerial list. There is really nothing to be excited about. When I saw it, what came to my mind was in a country of over 200 million people, is this  the best we could afford? This government is behaving as if we are short of talent  in the country. Some of the new ministers  are former governors who failed woefully  in their states. How can somebody who failed as a governor  with all the money  and executive powers  at his disposal succeed as a minister? Even some of the ministers  who were returned  did not make much impact  in their ministries during their first tenure, so what magic are we expecting them to make this time around? So, the list does not inspire hope and confidence in Nigerians. It fell short of what Nigerians need at this point that we are at cross road as a people.
