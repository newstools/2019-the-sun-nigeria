To Nigerians in the diaspora, this is Manhattan in New York or West Hampstead in London. This post is a reaction to Daniel Shodamola’s post on the 6 best residential Estates with decent houses on Lagos Island. I have put together a list of residential estates on the mainland which are either unpopular or unrecognised. The fact that everyone is drifting to the Island does not mean that there are no good apartments for men and women of high calibers on the Lagos mainland. A residential estate is a group of homes and other buildings built together as a single development. It is usually built by a single contractor, with only a few styles of house or building design, so they tend to be uniform in appearance. Most people already assume that residential estates are very expensive because of the services that come with them. The good news is, residential estates on the Lagos mainland are not as expensive as those on the Island, yet residents still tend to enjoy the same benefits.
