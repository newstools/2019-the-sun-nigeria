The stage is set for another cultural watershed with the National Council for Arts and Culture playing host to no less than 36 ambassadors, high commissioners and representatives of countries drawn from around the world to a pre-International Arts and Crafts Expo dinner in Abuja. The assemblage of countries like South Africa, Iran, Cameroun, Spain, China, Sudan, Venezuela, USA and many more from every continent in the world at the pre-INAC dinner, is a deliberate attempt by NCAC to rewrite the culture narratives of Nigeria as it prepares for a groundbreaking 2019 Expo. Giving his welcome address during the dinner, the Director General of NCAC, Otunba Segun Runsewe,  thanked the various Ambassadors and High Commissioners for gracing the occasion recalling that it was an improvement from the 22 countries that participated in the 2018 edition of the event. Runsewe said the essence of the dinner was to provide a platform for Diplomats to interact and unwind in an informal atmosphere in a bid to further cement the cordial relationship already existing between them and the host country, Nigeria. Acccording to the culture chief, the 3rd edition of INAC will dedicate an entire day to any country interested in entertaining the envoys noting that last year witnessed phenomenal entertainment from countries like China, India and Bangladesh. After dinner, Otunba Runsewe presented souvenirs to the Envoys just as he revealed that plans are also underway to ensure this year’s Cultural Diplomacy Day for Peace slated for November 24th is marked to establish a cultural link amongst nations with the aim of ensuring a common network of cultural identities.
