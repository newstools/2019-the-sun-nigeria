Earlier, the Operations Controller for DPR in Ogun, Mrs. Muinat Bello-Zagi, said the awareness programme became necessary in order to promote safe, effective and reliable transportation of petroleum products along the highways. She observed that the number of accidents involving petroleum products tankers in Ogun State had increased significantly, hence the need to take swift action.
