A total of 20 crew members were rescued in the East China Sea on Saturday, according to the Donghai Rescue Bureau of the China Ministry of Transport. A container ship that is registered in the Marshall Islands lost power, due to mechanical problems caused by a typhoon about 25 nautical miles east of the Yangtze River estuary on Friday evening. The bureau immediately organised and implemented a rescue operation after receiving word of the shipâ€™s distress, sending a rescue ship at 5:30 a.m. on Saturday and rescuing the crew aboard the vessel. The container ship will arrive at its destination on Saturday evening after being rescued by the bureau. (Xinhua/NAN)
