The command’s spokesperson, DSP Folashade Odoro, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the police was fully prepared for the outcome. “Officers have been placed on red alert and are pro-active to prevent any kind of violence or demonstration in the state. “We will, however, want to urge people of the state to maintain law and order and go about their lawful businesses without fear or intimidation,” she said.
