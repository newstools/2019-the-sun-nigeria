Brown Chimezie Moved by economic challenges  and corruption facing the nation , the Chartered  Institute of Administration (CIA), has call on the Federal Government to make CIA certificate compulsory for all heads of government  parastatals. This statement was made recently during the 43rd induction of new members and the conferment of professor of administration on the founder of the Institute, Admin Akobundu Okoronkwo,  by  Institut Superieur, Fopase University Benin Republic. According to president of the  institute, Adm Samson Olopade, corruption and poor implementation of budget and planning stem from maladministration. He said as a professional  body fully certified by the FG with Act No.I03 of 1992 now Cap C7 LFN 2004, the institute is empowered  to regulate the training and practice of Administration  within a professional framework throughout the country. While Charging the inductees to be upright in discharging their duties in line with training that they have received in the institute,  Olopade said: “As members, you would be required to subscribe and adhere strictly  to the institute’s code of ethics. As professionals, we are required to place public or employers interest above self interest In our respective organisations”, he  said. On why most professionals abuse their office, Olopade said poor corporate governance  and inefficient  administrative  process and procedures are largely  responsible for these unwholesome practices.  He said CIA has trained and fully equipped its members to effectively  perform  credibly. Earlier, Head, Corporate  affairs and member governing council of the institute, Dr Noble Oguguo said the relevance of CIA to Nigeria is the fact that the bane of socio-economic doldrums  in the nation stem from maladministration, hence the goal of the institute  is to reverse this ugly trend. He said if properly deployed, CIA  as a ‘mother administrator’ was capable of solving this problem through training  in form of mental revolution.
