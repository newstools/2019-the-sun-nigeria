The Liberia Football Association president Musa Bility has said he will file a case at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas). Bilty is unhappy with what he calls the ‘co-operation agreement’ between the Confederation of African Football (Caf) and Fifa. In a statement he said he will file a case imminently seeking to have the agreement made “null and void with immediate effect”. The recent agreement will see Fifa Secretary-General Fatma Samoura work with Caf as a “General Delegate to Africa”. A move he hopes Cas “will give interim orders stopping the hostile takeover of Caf by Fifa and especially the decision to bring Fatma Samoura to head the Caf Secretariat.”
