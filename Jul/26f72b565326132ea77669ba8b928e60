Godwin Tsa, Abuja Members of the five-man presidential election petition tribunal were yesterday glued to the three video clips played by the Peoples Democratic Party and its presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, to support their allegations contained in their petition challenging the outcome of the February 23, 2019 presidential election. The video clips were played at the tribunal on Monday against stiff opposition from President Muhammadu Buhari, the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The respondents had through their respective counsels, objected to the admissibility of the electronic generated evidence. However, the Justice Mohammed Garba led presidential tribunal overruled their objections and ordered that the 48 video compact Discs be played. The Justice Mohammed Garba-led five-man tribunal held that the objection by the respondents was baseless as the 48 video compact discs sought to be tendered by the petitioners were covered by the agreement reached at the pre-hearing session in respect of the case. The tribunal unanimously held that as it had been done in respect of other exhibits tendered by the petitioners in line with the pre-hearing agreement, the respondents could only raise their objection to the admissibility of video exhibits and give reasons for it at the final address stage The tribunal went on to admit the VCDs as Exhibits P36 to P83. The certificate of compliance with the provision of the Evidence Act accompanying the exhibits was admitted as Exhibit 84. Following the ruling, the petitioners, through their lawyer, Chief Chris Uche (SAN), played the video clips which were produced by their 40th petitioners’ witnesses, Segun Showunmi, who is the media adviser and spokesperson for Atiku. Three of the video clips played included an interview a Resident Electoral Commission of the Independent National Electoral Commission, Mike Iginni, granted on Sunday Politics programme of Channels Television when he said the results of the election would be transmitted to INEC’s server. In the interview Igini was showed giving details of how results would be collated from units to wards to local government and then the state, therein the results so collated would be transmitted to the INEC central server through the use of the smart card reader However, under cross-examination by INEC led counsel, Yunus Usman (SAN), Atiku’s Witness admitted that Igini was not the official spokesman for INEC. In another video recording, played in the courtroom, INEC chairman, Professor Mahmood Yakubu expressed optimism before the election that the Commission would use the electronic system during the conduct of the 2019 general elections. In another video played and admitted by the Tribunal, the Nigerian Army through its spokesman, said at a Media briefing that the attention of the Army had been drawn to a claim by Major General Muhammadu Buhari that he obtained the West African School Certificate (WAEC) in 1961.
