Garba stated that one suspect was arrested in connection with one of the seizures. He, however, warned those who engage in illegal activities and other cross-border vices to avoid Seme border or risk arrest and possible prosecution. He, therefore, urged all unit heads to ensure adequate supervision of their subordinates in order to facilitate legitimate trade across the frontier, while equally keeping a healthy relationship with the critical stakeholders. He said: “This will ensure that our core mandate as directed is achieved. The holistic approach in executing the mandate of the service, will lead to an all-encompassing result as revenue generation, suppression of smuggling and legitimate trade facilitation will be adequately enhanced at the Lagos –Abidjan corridor without compromising National Security.” The Comptroller assured members of both local and business communities that the command will increase dialogue, enlightenment and robust stakeholder engagements for seamless operations through the modern Joint Border Post, which is the first of its kind in the West African sub-region designed to promote regional integration, reduce clearing times at the border, increase government revenue, improve the free movement of persons and goods, eliminate corruption and loss of revenue at the borders, reduction of delays, operating cost and availability of baseline data for impact assessment.
