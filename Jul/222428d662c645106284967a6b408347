BBC Odion Ighalo scored the only goal as Nigeria beat Tunisia in the third-place play-off at the Africa Cup of Nations. Ex-Watford striker Ighalo tapped in after Tunisia keeper Moez Ben Cherifia deflected the ball off his own defender Yassine Meriah. In a slow-paced game between the two losing semi-finalists in Cairo, Tunisia went close as Ferjani Sassi and Ghaylene Chaalali shot wide. Three-time winners Nigeria have now finished third eight times. Tunisia, champions in 2004, needed a finger-tip save from Cherifia to deny Samuel Chukwueze in the second half and the keeper was called on again injury time to acrobatically save Samuel Kalu’s free-kick. Senegal will look for their first Afcon title when they face 1990 winners face Algeria in Friday’s final. And so we end as 3rd!
