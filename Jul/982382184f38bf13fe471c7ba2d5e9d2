This is really painful, having served the country in various capacities. ‘We are yet to get our rewards after winning the Nations Cup and representing the country in our first World Cup in 1994. The government has left me alone in the quest to rescue my mum. “I’m disappointed and I think something needs to be done,” Siasia said. Siasia, who had since been out of job since winning the Olympic bronze in 2017, pleaded with the kidnappers to release his mother and other family members.
