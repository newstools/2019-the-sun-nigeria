Isilomo Braimoh, a housemate in the ongoing Big Brother Naija (BBNaija) season 4 said, losing her job triggered her interest to participate in the audition for the reality show. Braimoh said that her being fired from her job, gave her the time to take part in the auditions of BBNaija, adding that it was a blessing in disguise. Braimoh shared her story with other housemates as they continued to reveal how they all audited and got to the house. According to her, she was working at a very good company in Lagos, until she got fired in January, where she accused one of her colleagues for being responsible for her sack. “Taking a trip from Lagos to Abuja after getting fired from my job made my audition for the show possible, where I eventually got selected from the thousands who showed up for the auditions.” Isilomo, already proposed a strategic alliance with fellow housemate, Ella, as she continues to battle for the BBNaija ultimate prize of N60 million Naira. Isilomo who resides in Lagos is single and ready to mingle. An HR manager at 27, Isilomo has an MA in Human Resource Management with professional certification. She winds down from her hectic job by engaging in sports, outdoor activities, food, music, and travel. A lover of all things music, her favourite songs are currently ‘Middle Child’ by J.Cole and ‘Daz How Star Do’ by Skiibii.
