Nze, who sought for the urgent evacuation by the affected state governments during the sensitisation workshop on 2019 flood prediction, prevention, and mitigation in hydrological area 1, comprising Kebbi, Sokoto, Zamfara, Katsina and Niger states noted that the high-risk flood might occur between July and September 2019. Nze, represented by a Director Hydrologeophysics Department of the agency, disclosed that eight local government areas in Kebbi State including; Aliero, Argungu, Augie, Bagudo, Birnin-Kebbi, Bunza ,Ngaski and Shanga are prone to flooding this year.
