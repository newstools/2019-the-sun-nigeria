Sola Ojo, Kaduna As leader of Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) also known as Shi’ite appears in Kaduna High Court today,  c ommercial activities in  Kaduna, the state capital, have  been seriously affected  with several residents staying indoor. This development, was premised on pro-El-Zakzaky release protests which have been violent in nature lately. The Shi’ite leader and his wife were arrested on December 14, 2015 by security agents after a bloody clash between his followers and the Nigerian Army that left scores dead. Before now, the protest had been limited to Abuja, Kaduna and a few other places in the North, but it has  gradually spread  to other states including Lagos. A business owner at  the popular Ahmadu Bello way, Kaduna, who did not want his name mentioned said that previous experiences have taught them how to avoid damning risk anytime the case comes up. “We have had bad experiences. Some of the people involved in the protest are shop looters’’ he said.
