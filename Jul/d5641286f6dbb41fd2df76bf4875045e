Fourteen years ago, specifically on February 2, 2005, I signed off from this medium as a member of the Editorial Board and Friday Back Page columnist to join one of the country’s banks as a corporate communications manager. The memorable article was entitled “My valedictory memoirs”. I received many multi-media responses. The swiftest and most enduring feedback I got was from Mr. Kabir Dangogo, former Deputy General Manager (Corporate Affairs), Union Bank PLC, who cautioned me against hasty jubilation over the new lease of life! His invaluable advisory was based on his long and tortuous experience in the industry. It did not take months of my crossing over to appreciate Dangogo’s reservations. The SMS he sent to me became a piercing reminder of my past, present and future. On reflection, if I had consulted this fine man before rushing into banking, it is belatedly clear to me that I would not have made that wrong decision which culminated in my professional disconnectedness, if not ruination! On retrospection, I blame the University of Leicester-trained Dangogo for not insistently calling me to order then! I hold him vicariously culpable for being an accessory to the fact of my wrong step! The details of this fatalistic misadventure are contained in my fourth upcoming book.As you read this, today marks the sixth anniversary of my formal return to The Sun family after leprous years of sabbatical prodigality (excuse the pun!) in the banking and telecommunications sectors as SSA to the Chief Whip of the Nigerian Senate and former governor of Abia State who also publishes this medium and New Telegraph, Senator (Dr.) Orji Uzor Kalu (MON), who personally initiated the process of my return to this soar-away stable. I must thank him especially for this privileged encore considering the boyishness of my ill-advised exit at the peak of my relevance to journalism and career flourish in this Voice of The Nation! As a recap, I have decided to go down memory lane by publishing, for the first time, some of the emotional reminiscences I got when I left this same ship in 2005 as a re-introductory prefatory, starting, of course, with that of iconic Dangogo, a man of erudition swimming in naira in Abuja! “Congratulations on your new bank job. Welcome to our world. I am glad you are on sabbatical. I would have said your valedictory memoirs may be too soon! Wish you good luck.”  “I just read your ‘My valedictory memoirs’ and I must tell you that I am one person that enjoys your column. I will miss you so much.

To me, DAILY SUN’s back page on Fridays has been my delight. Your practice is not that of bread and butter, but that of integrity, fearlessness and service. This nation needs men like you. Men who will call white what it is and not black. You never said where you were going. I wish you well. (Etim Inyang, Calabar) “My dear brother, Ebere, may I use this opportunity to wish you a blissful and prosperous banking job. For about a year, I discovered your column I never missed it any Friday. May the Almighty God continue to bless you. Amen.” (Rev. (Engr.)

Ogala, 08055238554) “My brother Wabara, I read your valedictory memoirs with restricted tears because of your mature and well-nurtured analytical reasoning on national issues not minding whose ox is gored.

Please, let us know where you are.” (Chief Emechebe, 08023221803) “Ebere, your farewell note touches my heart. I wish you long life and success in all your endeavours. I miss your educative column.” (Abdullahi, Kano, 08036371157) “So, aluta is not continua again, abi? As you have joined them, at least OBJ will rest small in your hand. Congrats!” (Richard Akinnola, 08033147440) “Congratulations! May God protect you as you move higher and higher, but how many of you do we still have in this ‘guard’ pen business? Not many…! For most of them are mercenaries without courage, lovers of brown envelopes. Bye.” (Nwokike Titus, 08054075911) “Why is it this sudden? I will miss your column. This is wishing you a rewarding stay in the banking industry. Welcome.” (Dare, ETB, Ibadan, 08055068526) “Congratulations sir. You will surely be missed. Do not compromise on national issues. I wish you the best.” (Niyi, 08055661085) “Oga Wabara, I just stumbled on Friday’s first edition and just promptly read your article since I am one of your fans. May God be with you and may you find fulfilment in your new assignment.” (Morakinyo Abodunrin) FOOTNOTE: From ETB I was redeployed to Globacom as a Public Relations Manager at the instance of my incomparable benefactor, Dr. Mike Adenuga Jr., (GCON), and later came back to ETB as a media trouble-shooter. I moved on to Sterling Bank PLC briefly before calling it quits via resignation because of institutional culture shock nurtured by systemic cronyism and returned to The Sun. Time flies, indeed! I hope that the authors of the foregoing testamentary notes are still alive. Otherwise, peaceful rest I wish the departed.
