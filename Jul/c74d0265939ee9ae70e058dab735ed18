(The) 2019 African Cup of Nations marks my last championship for the national team with Super Eagles. “My national career started in 2003 under 17 World Cup and I’m grateful for the national team for placing me on the world arena and giving me an opportunity to show my skill and have an incredible national and international career. “At the age of 32, it’s time for me to retire from the national team and let the youth take over, who’ve done an amazing job securing a bronze medal at AFCON 2019,” he said while thanking Nigerians for their support, trust and love shown him in the last 15 years.
