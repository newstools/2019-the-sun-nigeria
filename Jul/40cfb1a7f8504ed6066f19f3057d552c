Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure Governors of the six states of the southwest geo-political zone have reaffirmed their stand against nomadism in the region and called on the Federal government to introduce ranches for the purpose of cattle rearing.
This is even as eminent personalities and leaders of thought in Yoruba land called for the abolition of nomadism in the region. Chairman of the South West Governors Forum and Governor of Ondo State, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu who spoke on behalf of other governors during a condolence visit to the leader of Pan-Yoruba socio-cultural group,
Afenifere, Chief Reuben Fasoranti in Akure, said the six governors of Oyo, Osun, Ekiti, Ondo, Lagos and Ogun
states are tired of the evils being perpetrated by Fulani herdsmen. Although the Osun State governor, Mr Gboyega Oyetola, was absent, Akeredolu said he had earlier spoken with him on the position of the other governors and he had his mandate to speak. The governors who were in Akure for the burial of Mrs Funke Olakunrin, daughter of Fasoranti declared that an end would come to insecurity in the region, going by the efforts they were making. Akeredolu specifically said that the governors had resolved to take drastic measures to end killings and kidnapping in the South West, regretting that the forests in the region were being used as a hiding place by the bandits. But he said the forests would not be destroyed because they are pride of the region and hinted that the governments of the state states would further encourage aforestation. However, he said he had directed the police commissioner in Ondo State to direct his men to embark on 24-hours patrol, rather than being at the checkpoints, adding that other governors in the region had done similar thing. He said through that, the menace of insecurity in the region would end. The governor also called for the collaboration of all citizens in the fight against insecurity in the region. A leader of Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo condemned the activities of the Fulani herdsmen in the region and urged the governors to collectively fight the menace of insecurity ravaging the zone. Also speaking, former Minister of Aviation, Chief Femi Fani Kayode said the position of the governors if fully implemented would help in the fight against insecurity, adding: “I pray the governors to have the courage to present their position to President Muhammadu Buhari.” He said: “If it is true that there are Fulani vigilantes operating in the South West and mounting roadblocks, then it is a recipe for disaster and a precursor to war. “Our people will not take it. If they are really there they should get out of the South West and go and do their vigilante in the North. We have not been annexed by the Fulani; we are not an occupied territory neither are we slaves,” he added. function insertAfter(e,t){t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t.nextSibling)}function getElementByXPath(e,t){if(!t)t=document;if(t.evaluate)return t.evaluate(e,document,null,9,null).singleNodeValue;while(e.charAt(0)=="/")e=e.substr(1);var n=t;var r=e.split("/");for(var i=0;i<r.length;i++){var a=r[i].split(/(\w*)\[(\d*)\]/gi).filter(function(e){return!(e==""||e.match(/\s/gi))},this);var l=a[0];var o=a[1]?a[1]-1:0;if(i<r.length-1)n=n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o];else return n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o]}}if(!Array.prototype.filter){Array.prototype.filter=function(e){var t=this.length>>>0;if(typeof e!="function"){throw new TypeError}var n=[];var r=arguments[1];for(var i=0;i<t;i++){if(i in this){var a=this[i];if(e.call(r,a,i,this)){n.push(a)}}}return n}}function injectWidgetByXpath(e){var t=getElementByXPath(e);if(t==null){t=document.getElementById("tbdefault")}innerInject(t)}function injectWidgetByMarker(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);innerInject(t.parentNode)}function innerInject(e){var t=document.createElement("span");var n=document.createElement("script");var r="if JS crashes here, the first innerHTML value should be enclosed with single quotes instead of double, go to the minified version and change it";t.innerHTML="<div id='taboola-below-article'></div><div id='taboola-below-article-second'></div>";n.innerHTML="window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-c', container:'taboola-below-article', placement:'below-article', target_type: 'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-d', container:'taboola-below-article-second', placement:'below-article-2nd', target_type: 'mix'});";insertAfter(t,e);insertAfter(n,t)}injectWidgetByMarker('tbmarker');
