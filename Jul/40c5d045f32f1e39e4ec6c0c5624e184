Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr has given the duo of Victor Osim- hen and Henry Onyekuru hope of playing in the match against Algeria today. Speaking at a pre-match press conference at the Cairo International Stadium, Rohr said he had used 20 of the 23 registered players for the Africa Cup of Nations and hopes to feature both Osimhen and Onyekuru in the next match. “We’ve used 20 of the 23 players for the AFCON, and two of the remaining three players; Osimhen and Onyekuru might get their chance against Algeria or the next game. But, for the third goalkeeper, I doubt if he will get opportunity. “Against Madagascar, we tried the second goalkeeper, and altogether we changed five players for the match. In the match against Cameroon, we also introduced two players, same as in the match against South Africa.
