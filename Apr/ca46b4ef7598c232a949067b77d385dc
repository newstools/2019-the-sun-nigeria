(NAN)CAF Champions League champions, Esperance of Tunisia are on course to defend the title after they defeated CS Constantine 3-2 away from home in the first leg of the quarter-finals on Saturday. However, Egyptian giants Al Ahly were hammered 5-0 by Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa. Al Ahly, Africaâ€™s most successful club, went into the tie as favourites, but they quickly found themselves in a difficult situation, as Themba Zwane knocked in from close range in the 14th minute. Wayne Arendse doubled the deficit 10 minutes later from a similar distance after a free-kick, and the Sundowns opened up a three-goal lead with a Ricardo Nascimento penalty just after half-time. Leandro Sirino got in on the act just past the hour, firing home from the centre of the box, and Phakamani Mahlambi completed the rout late on, bundling in a right-wing cross to all but secure a spot in the semi-finals. ES Tunis will expect to join the Sundowns in the final four after they left Algeria with a victory.

The other two games finished goalless, as TP Mazembe and Wydad Casablanca held their respective hosts Simba and Horoya.
