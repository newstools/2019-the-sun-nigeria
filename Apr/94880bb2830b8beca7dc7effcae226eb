Sadio Mane would set Real Madrid back more than £130million should Zinedine Zidane swoop for the Liverpool star this summer. Zidane is planning a huge overhaul at the Bernabeu this summer, with Mane, Eden Hazard and Paul Pogba all near the top of his list. But, according to El Confidencial, Mane would be a ‘luxury’ signing for them with his price tag expected to be exorbitant. The Spanish outlet report that Liverpool are unwilling to sell such a prized asset so cheaply, especially if Philippe Coutinho’s £145m transfer to Barcelona last year is any yardstick to go by. The Senegal international has been a vital prong in Liverpool’s inexorable three-man forward line, along with Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino, this year. Mane has smashed 21 goals in 42 games in all competitions this term and has drawn the gaze of newly-reappointed Madrid boss Zidane. And Zidane knows that any of his favoured targets won’t come cheaply. Should he acquire Pogba, who has two-and-a-half years left to run on his deal at Old Trafford, from Manchester United it would cost around the same price as Mane. Madrid are, of course, hoping to recoup at least some of the money and free up some space on their wage bill by offloading some of their big-name players.
