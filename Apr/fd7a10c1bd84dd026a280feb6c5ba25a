Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari has said his campaign in all states of the Federation, while seeking re-election, was an eye-opener. This was even as he assured Nigerians that he will put in all efforts to ensure the best for the country; when he begins a second term on May 29. Buhari said this when he met with the Board of Trustees and Advisory Council of Gidauniyar Jihar Katsina (Katsina State Development Fund), led by Justice Mamman Nasir (retd); at the State House, yesterday. The president said: “Thank you for supporting me. I assure you that I will do my best during the second term. We will work for Nigeria and her people.” Buhari added that the crowd that welcomed his campaign train in each state was more than anyone could possibly “induce,” and attributed the turnouts to people’s appreciation of the efforts of his administration. The president noted that he was chairman of the Katsina State Development Fund for 17 years, during which period “a lot was done to support education, healthcare and agriculture in the state, especially for the less-privileged.” In his remarks, Justice Nasir, who is also the Galadima of Katsina, said the foundation returns gratitude to God and all Nigerians for giving president Buhari the opportunity to serve another term in office. “We are most grateful to Almighty Allah for bringing you back for another term in office. Our happiness and gratitude goes to Nigerians for electing you,’’ he said. Justice Nasir said the foundation also remains grateful for the years the president served as its chairman.
