Cholera cases in cyclone-hit Mozambique have risen above 1,400, government officials said yesterday, as hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses arrived in an attempt to limit the rapid spread of the disease. Authorities announced a second death from cholera, which causes acute diarrhea and is spread by contaminated food and water conditions that some 128,000 displaced cyclone survivors now risk daily while living in temporary, often crowded, shelters. Cholera can kill within hours if not treated. Authorities yesterday also said the overall death toll in Mozambique from the cyclone had risen to 598. The number has been called very preliminary and the real toll may never be known, with some people quickly buried or washed away. The cholera outbreak has grown swiftly since it was declared last week with five confirmed cases. Now there are 1,428, most of them in the hard-hit port city of Beira, which has been the hub of relief efforts since Cyclone Idai roared in on March 14. The city of a half-million residents is most at risk from cholera but the disease also is reported in outlying communities in central Mozambique. The new death was in Dondo, government officials said.
