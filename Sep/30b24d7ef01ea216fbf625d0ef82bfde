Market analysts say that the post election tribunal ruling was the deciding factor that changed the sentiments of investors.
The Presidential Election Petition Tribunal had on Wednesday upheld President Muhammadu Buhari’s re-election.
The tribunal held that Atiku Abubakar and the PDP have failed to discharge the burden of proof of the allegation of non-qualification of President Buhari to contest the February 23 general election. Atiku had told the tribunal to nullify Buhari’s election and declare him the authentic winner of the election.
Delivering judgment, Justice Mohammed Garba, held that evidence before the court showed that Buhari obtained Cambridge West African Examination Council (WAEC).
Garba held that it has been established that a candidate is not required under the Electoral Act to attach his certificate to his Form CF001 before a candidate is adjudged to have the requisite qualification to contest the election.
The tribunal also held that technological facilities like card readers, transmission of election results via server were strange to the country’s laws.
Speaking to Sunday Sun, a stockbroker who craved anonymity said: “The Finance Minister released the Medium Term Expenditure Framework for 2020-2022, which has brought about a measure of how the government intends to spend money and raise money for the medium term.
“I think it is going to the National Assembly and that is what improved market sentinments. Secondly, the ruling verdict that Buhari won has also given foreign investors that things will pretty much remain the same so they can decide where to put their money. “This has brought a measure of stability that things will remain stable in the near-to-medium term”.
Also speaking, President, Pearl Awards, Taiwo Orekoya, noted that even though the market is yet to see the impact of the cabinet, the market will be on the gaining ground.
“The cabinet has just been constituted, but more importantly, there is need for a strong economic team that would put in place the fiscal and the macroeconomic policies that will be sustained over time that will drive activities in the real sector of the economy,” he said.
