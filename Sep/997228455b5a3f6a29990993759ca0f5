Fred Itua, Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Senate Caucus has raised the alarm over the raid on the Abuja residence of the governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, allegedly by the police. The caucus has accordingly urged the Inspector-General of Police to order an immediate and thorough investigation into the matter, to unravel the circumstances and those behind the action. In statement by the Minority Leader of the Senate, Enyinnaya Abaribe, on behalf of the caucus in Abuja yesterday, described the raid as not only a direct attack on democracy, but also an affront on the fundamental rights of citizens of Nigeria. Abaribe said the probe has become necessary against the backdrop of the mystery surrounding the early morning raid and subsequent denials by the police of being responsible for the action. He further said he was at a loss as to why the police seem to be foot-dragging in constituting a panel to probe the ugly incident, even when it is claiming that thugs and not the police were responsible for the invasion. His words: “Let’s assume it was hired thugs that invaded the residence of a sitting governor of a state, whose duty is it to apprehend the brigands? Or does raids by thugs not constitute a crime? “The police must come clear and the only way to do that is to carry out a thorough investigation and apprehend the culprits. We are in a democracy and people should not be made to live in fears as though we are in a lawless society. If a sitting governor could be subjected to such harrowing experience, then you can imagine what will happen to the man on the street.”
