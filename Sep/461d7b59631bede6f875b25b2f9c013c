Clement Adeyi, Osogbo Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun State has described the death of the president of Customary Court of Appeal, Justice Gloria Oladoke, as not only a loss to her family and the judiciary, but also the state at large. The governor who sent a state delegation led by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Prince Wole Oyebamiji, to Ile-Ife on Thursday to condole with her family, described the late jurist as an epitome of good character, integrity and selfless service. Oyetola, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Ismail Omipidan, commiserated with friends and professional colleagues of the late jurist, who served variously and meritoriously in Osogbo, Ede, Ilesa, Ikirun, Ila-Orangun and Ile-Ife divisions of the High Court, before she rose to the position of president. She was also at a point the acting Chief Judge of the state. Oladeko died on Thursday morning. The governor saluted Justice Oladoke’s forthrightness, deep sense of patriotism, loyalty and commitment to the discharge of justice, which helped in no small measure to validate the popular axiom of the judiciary being the last hope of the common man. The governor said: “I received with great shock, the passing of the president of the state’s Customary Court of Appeal. Her death is not only a loss to her family and the judiciary alone, but also to the state at large. “As people who believe in God, we should take it in good faith and give gratitude to God that the late jurist ran a good race while she was alive. As a professional who started her career in the old Oyo State as a youth corps member, the late Justice Oladoke showed class in the discharge of her responsibilities as a judge. “My deep condolences go to the entire family, the judiciary as well as the entire state. She will be surely missed. I pray for the peaceful repose of her soul and I pray God to give all of us the courage and fortitude to bear this irreplaceable loss.”
