It has been thirty-three years since I borrowed a library card From a shy, handsome, gap-toothed classmate He came to my university for a degree He left with his degree and something else Three years later we walked down the aisle A simple beautiful ceremony in London The dress was from Debenhams The suit was Italian With wedding rings from H. Samuel Jewelers And a lovely red and white cake that cost 90 pounds The party was supposed to end at 9pm We gave the Jamaican venue manager a pack of beer He beamed and said we could stay for as long we wanted Our family and friends in London danced all night On Monday we were homeless due to no fault of ours That is a story for another day! The seasons came and went Thirty of them and still counting As the Good Book says, there was a time for everything A time to paint and decorate A time to pack up and leave A time to agonise A time to rejoice A time to dream A time to plan A time to talk A time for silence A time for friends A time for enemies A time for tears A time for laughter Through it all there was one thing that defied time or circumstance It was always A Time for Love Thank you for all the wonderful years Thank you for being my friend Thank you for holding my hand And for placing yours in mine Thank you for being such an amazing father Thank you in advance, for all the great years to come Thank you for lending me your library card so long ago Without it, I would not have had such a life of love. â€¢Bisi Adeleye-Fayemi is a gender specialist, social entrepreneur and writer.
