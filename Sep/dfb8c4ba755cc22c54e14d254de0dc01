Some other doctors that were allegedly involved appeared before the tribunal at its previous sitting in Abuja. Chairman of the MDCN tribunal, Prof. Waziri, in his remarks assured the doctors that the tribunal was not out to witch-hunt or ridicule anybody, but to give opportunity to the accused persons to explain themselves and thus give the tribunal bases for judgment. While some of the accused doctors appeared in person, others were represented by their Counsels.
