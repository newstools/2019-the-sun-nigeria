Molly Kilete, Abuja The Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu has warned against the planned procession by the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN), saying the march is an act of terrorism. Adamu who gave the warning in Abuja, advised parents and guardians to prevail on their children and wards so that they will not be cajoled into embarking on what he described as “illegal and ill-motivated activities by anyone or group of persons, under any guise whatsoever.” He said he had, therefore, placed all state Commissioners of Police and Federal Capital Territory (FCT), on the alert to avert any planned procession and disruption of public peace by the IMN in any part of the country. The IGP, in a statement signed by Force Public Relations Officer Frank Mba said: “It has come to the knowledge of the Nigeria Police Force that some members of the proscribed Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) intend to embark on a nationwide procession, ostensibly to cause disruption of public peace, order and security in the Country. “The force notes that in line with the Terrorism (Prevention) Proscription Order Notice 2019 of 26th July 2019, the activities of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria have been proscribed. Consequently, all gathering or procession by the group remains ultimately illegal and will be treated as a gathering in the advancement of terrorism. “To this end, the Inspector-General of Police, M.A Adamu, NPM, has directed the Commissioners of Police in all the states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja as well as their supervisory Assistant Inspectors-General of Police to put in place concrete measures to avert any planned procession and/or disruption of public peace by the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, anywhere in the country. The IGP also enjoins the public to avail the force with useful information as regards the activities of the proscribed Islamic Movement in Nigeria. “In addition, the IGP has also advised parents and guardians to prevail on their children and wards not to be cajoled into embarking on illegal and ill-motivated activities by anyone or group of persons, under any guise whatsoever.”
