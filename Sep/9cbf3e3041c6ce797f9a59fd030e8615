Speaker of  Ekiti  State House of Assembly,  Funminiyi Afuye has directed the House Committee on Health and Human Services to investigate the mysterious death of  a family  of three  and their  two dogs. The victims and their dogs allegedly died after eating cassava-flour meal (amala) in Odo-Ayedun-Ekiti. Afuye gave the directive  yesterday following a motion moved by the member representing Ikole Constituency II, Mr Adeoye Aribibasoye, under Matter of Public Importance at  plenary   session . Aribibasoye, drew the  attention of  the assembly to the sad occurrence, and condemned the attitude of the health workers at  the first health facility where  victims were rushed to. He  called for  full investigation into  the matter. The lawmaker said that so far, a mother, two children and two of their dogs died while the father was still in a critical condition at the Federal Teaching Hospital, Ido-Ekiti. However, Afuye  directed  the committee to visit the family and town of the incident and report to the house.
