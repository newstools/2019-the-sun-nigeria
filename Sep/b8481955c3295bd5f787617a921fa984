U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, on Thursday responded to Iran’s threats of all-out war, by saying the U.S. wanted a peaceful resolution. “We are still striving to build out a coalition in an act of diplomacy while the foreign minister of Iran is threatening all-out war and to fight to the last American,“ he said. Pompeo told newsmen in Abu Dhabi that U.S. was ready to build up a coalition aimed at achieving peace, while holding talks with Crown Prince Mohammed Zayed-Al Nahyan. Pompeo, who also visited Saudi Arabia on earlier, added that a peaceful resolution was what President Donald Trump certainly set out to achieve. Meanwhile, Washington and Riyadh have already blamed Tehran for recent attacks on two Saudi oil facilities. (dpa/NAN)
