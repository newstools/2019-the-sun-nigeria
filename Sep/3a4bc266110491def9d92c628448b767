The Vice-Presidential candidates of the PDP, Mr. Peter Obi has advised Nigerian universities to look inwards for the development of their various schools. Obi said this during his visit to the University of Nigeria, Nsukka and Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka. Sharing managerial experiences with the some principal officers of the University of Nsukka led by the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Charles Igwe and that of Awka led by Prof, Charles Esimone, Obi  emphasized the need to work with dedicated men who understand that leadership is about service and embracing values that would encourage scholarship. Speaking further, Obi, by way of advice, challenged the leadership of institutions like the universities to study other successful universities worldwide such as Harvard in the USA and Oxford in the UK for factors that made for their successes and apply the same to their various institutions. Elaborating, Obi said that universities in Nigeria should seek alternative means of increasing their finances. “Alumni support and research are examples”, Obi said while quoting statistics to show that some universities in America and Europe, through effective alumni networking have billions in investment. “Frontline schools like Nsukka and Lagos can actually pioneer such efforts by diligently studying how the West does it”, Obi submitted. Obi contended that such effective use of alumnus associations would stem what he called the “uninspiring dependence on moneybags to build structures and be given honorary degrees as if it has cash value.” Responding both Vice chancellors thanked Obi for the visit and for his priceless advice, which stemmed from his practical experiential pedigree.
