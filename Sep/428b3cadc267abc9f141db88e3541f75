The other aircraft are expected to arrive Lagos as from next month. Said Hathiramani: “Earlier in the year, we noticed that there were fewer aircraft in the country and less capacity to meet the demand at the time, so we decided to acquire some Boeing 737 aircraft to ensure that passengers travel at ease without having to worry if they will get flights to certain destinations even at peak periods. ” “The arrival of the first of our recently acquired 737 aircraft is a firm confirmation of our resilience, operational efficiency, deep passion, and our commitment to continue flying safe. “We will also deploy this B737 to strengthen our existing route network while new routes will be announced soon in line with our careful and methodical route and fleet expansion project. “We would also deploy this B737 to strengthen our existing route network while new routes will be announced soon in line with our careful and methodical route and fleet expansion project,” he added.
