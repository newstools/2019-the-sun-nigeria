Access to energy received a boost yesterday, as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Sahara Group unveiled the Africa Renewable Energy Forum to boost access to sustainable energy for 10 million households in Africa through alternative energy initiatives and interventions. Launched at the margins of the ongoing 74th UN General Assembly in New York, the Africa Renewable Energy Forum is expected to bolster ongoing partnership between UNDP and the Sahara Group that aims to create access to clean and affordable energy in Africa. The forum will serve as a platform for policy discussions, multi-stakeholder collaboration and funding towards implementation of tailored renewable energy solutions across the continent. Ultimately, the platform will galvanise the political momentum needed to record significant progress through strong partnerships, effective regulation and mutual accountability. The event had senior officials from both organisations in attendance including, Ahunna Eziakonwa, Regional Director and Assistant Secretary General for UNDP Regional Bureau for Africa, Kola Adesina, Group Managing Director, Sahara Power Group, Pearl Uzokwe, Director, Governance and Sustainability, Sahara Group, Bethel Obioma, Head, Corporate Communications, Sahara Group and Babatomiwa Adesida, Private Sector Engagement Specialist, Sahara Foundation. Africa has the highest percentage of untapped hydropower potential in the world, with only 11 per cent utilisation capacity. Whilst the global electrification rate reached 89 per cent in 2018 and 153 million people gained access to electricity (WB Stats, May 2019), the biggest challenge remains in the most remote areas globally and sub-Saharan Africa in particular, where an estimated 573million people are not connected to grid power. With over 600million Africans having no access to electricity, Ahunna Eziakonwa said the continent urgently needs to embrace renewable energy sources to sustainably connect the poorest and hardest to reach households.
