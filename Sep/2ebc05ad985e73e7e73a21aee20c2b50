Wales lock Cory Hill has been ruled out of the Rugby World Cup after being unable to recover from a leg stress fracture, the Welsh Rugby Union confirmed on Tuesday. Dragons forward Hill will be replaced by Ospreys’ Bradley Davies, who will arrive in Japan on Wednesday. Wales head coach Warren Gatland had gambled by naming Hill in his World Cup squad, hoping the 27-year-old would recover in the early stages of the tournament. There were hopes the Hill would be fit to face Australia in Sunday’s Pool D showdown, but the after latest medical assessment Hill was advised to continue his rehabilitation back home. Wales had only two fit regular locks in Alun Wyn Jones and Jake Ball for Monday’s 43-14 victory over Georgia. Another lock, Adam Beard, is likely to miss the weekend’s clash against Australia as he recovers from surgery to remove his appendix. (Reuters/NAN)
