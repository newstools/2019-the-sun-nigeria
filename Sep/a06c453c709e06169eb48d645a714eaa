I’m super excited because my baby, Poshedup by EB is one-year-old already. It has been fun creating different pieces and seeing my posh lovers adorn my brand with so much love. “The brand was borne out of my love for looking simple, casual yet classy and chic, and of course, sexy. Recreating my personal style and seeing it on every fashion lover out there is quite encouraging and fulfilling. There are better years ahead for us.”
