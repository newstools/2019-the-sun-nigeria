It was sweet and bitter day in the office for Olanrewaju Kayode, after he was sent off in his Turkish clubâ€™s shock win over Besiktas. Promoted Gazisehir Gaziantep upset Besiktas 3-2 in front of their home fans, but they played a man short from the 75th minute, when Kayode was given a straight red card. He will now serve out a one-match ban. Before his dismissal, Kayode, who is on a season-long loan from Ukrainian champions Shakhtar Donetsk had provided an assist and caused a penalty in favour of his club. The 26-year-old striker had now scored two goals in four appearances in the Super Lig. His club is now sixth on the table with seven points from four matches.
