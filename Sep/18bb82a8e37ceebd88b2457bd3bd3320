However, the All-Share Index dipped 69.19 points or 0.25 per cent to close at 27,283.05 against 27,352.24 achieved on Tuesday due to profit taking in high capitalised stocks. Also, the market capitalisation which opened at N13.314 trillion shed N33 billion or 0.25 per cent to close at N13.281 trillion. The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, among which are; Dangote Cement, Guinness Nigeria, MTN Nigeria, Skyway Aviation Handling Company and Zenith Bank. The Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Consulting, Mr Ambrose Omordion, said the market maintained its volatile pattern as the ASI declined further, extending the negative sentiments for the third consecutive session. Omordion attributed the development to continued sell down and profit-taking ahead of quarter-end window dressing by fund managers and onset of the third quarter earnings reporting season in October. Analysts at Afrinvest Limited believed the bearish momentum would be sustained in subsequent sessions as investors maintained a risk-off approach towards equities. Market breadth closed negative, with 13 gainers versus 15 losers. Skyway Aviation Handling Company led the losersâ€™ chart with a loss of 9.89 per cent to close at N4.19 per share.
