He commended the immediate past commissioner in the ministry, Mr Uchenna Okafor, for introducing and initiating the uniform colour for all the commercial vehicles and tricycles in the state, stressing that it would go a long way in curbing crime in the state.

He further said the state Traffic Management Agency (ATMA) would be revitalised to continue to better serve the public. Madubuko stressed that he would want to work on ATMA as an agency to improve the transport sector in the state.
