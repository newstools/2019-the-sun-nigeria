Sahara Reporters publisher, activist and former presidential candidate Omoyele Sowore appeared before an Abuja federal court Monday morning, the first time since his arrest by the Department of State Services (DSS) on August 3. Sowore faces multiple charges of treasonable felony and cybercrime over his organised RevolutionNow protests earlier in August. Sowore and his co-defendant Olawale Bakare were represented in Monday’s hearing by counsel Adeyinka Olumide-Fusika, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria. Sowore has so far been denied bail and if found guilty of the charges may face several years in prison.
