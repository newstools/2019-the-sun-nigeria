Magnus Eze, Enugu, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu has advised Nigerians in South Africa to come back home because the present xenophobic attack on them by the countryâ€™s nationals will not end. He said that South Africans would continue to be envious of Nigerians and attack them as long as they lived in that country and made progress. He, however, blamed the South African government, which according to him, indirectly encouraged the attacks just as he urged President Muhammadu Buhari, to make a comprehensive statement on the matter rather than allowing his aides speak on the issue.
