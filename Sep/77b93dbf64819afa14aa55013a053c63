Super Eagles winger, Moses Simon, who came off the bench to score on his debut for the club away at Amiens, giving his club FC Nantes a win at home has continued where he stopped last weekend. Moses Simon continued his bright start in the French Ligue 1, as his assist fetched FC Nantes its first home win of the season with a 1-0 win over Montpellier. Both teams went goalless into the break, as they both failed to produce any moment of excitement for their fans in the first 45 minutes. FC Nantes, however broke their visitorsâ€™ resistance just six minutes away from time with the pacey Simon finding his way down the flanks to set up French midfielder, Abdoulaye Toure, who then beat a marker to find the back of the net, securing all three points of the match. It appeared the 24-year-old pacey winger is fully settled in his new environment with these impressive performances in his first two appearances for his club side.
