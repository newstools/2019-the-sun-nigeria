Peter Ogbukwa The CEO-designate of FoodCo Nigeria Limited, one of the leading super market chains in the Southwestern part of Nigeria, Ade Sun-Basorun, has charged consumer retail operators in Nigeria to take advantage of their knowledge of local business environment to reposition themselves for better performance and growth. Sun-Basorun, who is the co-author of the article: “Africa’s Growing Giant: Nigeria’s New Retail Economy-” gave this charge during a media parley with   journalists, adding that opportunities for growth still abound in the country despite the challenges facing the economy. According to him,    Food   and   Consumer   Goods sector is   projected   to generate $40 billion in revenue by 2020. He, however, lamented that the organized   retail   sub-sector   currently   accounts   for   less   than   20 percent of the total ecosystem, saying that the figure is grossly inadequate for the country’s growing middle-class and fast expanding urban population. He maintained that integrating   digitization into the   core   fabric   of business   operations would accelerate profitable growth for local operators in the space.
