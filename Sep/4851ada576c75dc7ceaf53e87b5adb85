The domestic bourse sustained Monday’s bearish outing as sell-offs in Stanbic IBTC, GT Bank and MTNN drove the All Share Index (ASI) southwards by 1.08 per cent  to 27,352.24 points.

Wednesday’s session further closed in the red as the ASI shed 0.5 per cent to settle at 27,283.05 points on the back of sell-offs in the shares of Dangote Cement, MTNN and Zenith Bank. Consequently, investors lost N44 billion in value as market capitalisation declined to N13.281 trillion while YTD loss worsened to -13.2 per cent.

Positive noises from China on U.S. trade talks had lifted European stocks on Thursday and snuffed out a modest rally in safe-haven assets that had dominated in Asia and this is said to have a mild impact on Nigeria’s stock market. Europe’s main bourses had initially stuttered, but muscled 0.5 per cent higher when China said it was in close communication with Washington and preparing to make progress in upcoming trade talks. U.S. President Donald Trump had also stoked hopes when he told reporters the two sides were having “good conversations” and that an agreement could be reached.
Reviewing the weekly performance of the market, the Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Consulting, Ambrose Omordion, attributed the development to continued sell down and profit-taking ahead of quarter-end window dressing by fund managers and onset of the third quarter earnings reporting season in October.
For his part, Head, Research and Investments, FSL Securities Limited, Victor Chiazor, noted that the Nigerian market is down currently as a result of global oil prices, as well as the sluggish growth of the nation’s economy. Chiazor said: “Once your economy is not moving as fast as expected, the market will suffer, Q2 GDP was out at 1.94 per cent which clearly shows that the economy is not moving as fast as people would have hoped as it fell lower than Q1. “Also we are having issues around oil prices which remain Nigeria’s source of revenue. We have seen a lot of volatility in that space and that is going to send wrong signals to the market.
Once the foreigners are not buying shares, the market will remain bearish because they dominate a significant portion of the market. “In August, foreign participation was about 52.3 per cent compared to domestic participation which accounted to about 47.6 per cent, clearly showing that they are the drivers of our equities market. Until they see reason to come into the equities market on a large scale, we might not see that activity. A lot of funds are not coming into the market as it should despite the low prices seen in the market”. He maintained that with the new economic team there might be a probability of the bulls returning to the market in the shortest time.
