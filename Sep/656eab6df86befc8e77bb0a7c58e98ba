Secondly, it is unique for us at First Bank of Nigeria Limited, as it coincides with our 125th Anniversary. This is not just because we are the first bank to be established in West Africa, but much more because we have been woven into the fabric of society and can feel FirstBank in every other institution and every aspect of the economy.”
