Folaranmi, Yenagoa Barely 24 hours to People’s Democratic Party (PDP) governorship primary election, the path to the governorship ticket was further made smooth for Senator Douye Diri by the Governor Henry Seriake Dickson-led political group nicknamed Restoration Team as PDP stakeholders from Nembe, Yenagoa, Sagbama, Brass and Ogbia local government areas endorsed him. The endorsement from poll watchers has dealt a fatal blow to the aspiration of the Deputy Governor, Rear Admiral Gboribiogha John Jonah (rtd) and the Secretary to the State Government, Mr Kemela Okara from Nembe and Yenagoa LGAs respectively. The PDP stakeholders meeting for Nembe was held at Domaris Hotel, chaired by the Commissioner for Education, Hon Robinson Obuebite.

Obuebite flanked by the Chairman of Nembe Local Government Council, Chief Alalibo West and member representing Nembe Constituency 1 in the House of Assembly, Hon Ben Ololo, stated that Dickson as the leader of the PDP in the state had been good to Nembe people and to reciprocate the love the governor has for Nembe kingdom, they would need to follow his lead in picking a visionary leader like Diri. The stakeholders while listing all the achievements the Dickson government had achieved in eight years, maintained that they were endorsing Diri independent of any promptings from Governor Dickson, noting that from all the 21 aspirants, Diri represents the best option to forge ahead with the restoration dream. The meeting of Yenagoa PDP stakeholders which held at Yenagoa Local Government Council multipurpose Hall and chaired by Hon Oforji Oboku, member representing Yenagoa Constituency 1, said they are endorsing Diri because of his sterling qualities to continue from where Dickson would stop.
