The letter said members of APC in Ukwa West were taken aback to learn that the president had approved the nomination of Nwogu as Abia representative on the Board of the NDDC Giving reason for their stance, the letter stated that “The factionalisation of APC in Ukwa West was orchestrated by Nwogu and his benefactor, Chief Ikechi Emenike. “Mr. President, we want to state that the  National Chairman of the party,  Adams Oshiomhole at the Umuahia Township stadium, publicly disowned Emenike having observed his sinister motives against the party. We foresee an unending crisis in Abia APC if this appointment is allowed to stay. “We state categorically that the reappointment of the nominee into the board of the NDDC will only lead to the decimation of the party in our area and weakening of the party structure at the state level.
