Magnus Eze  Barely 24 hours after Imo State governor, Emeka Ihedioha, was declared the winner of the governorship election by the tribunal, misfortune has befallen two strong members of the ruling People’s Democratic Party (PDP), in the state.  While a top staff of the Recovery Committee of the state government and PDP member, simply identified as Bruno was allegedly shot dead at the popular Cherubim Junction on Whetheral Road in the state capital, the party’s chairman for Owerri-West Local Government Area (LGA), Comrade Uzochukwu Azuatalam was abducted by gunmen.  The sad event occurred when Comrade Azuatalam was making his way back home after a political meeting in Ohii Owerri-West LGA. It was reported that his abductors trailed him from the said meeting and picked him up, after intercepting his vehicle along the road.  For the deceased, it is not yet clear if it was a case of assassination just as kidnappers were yet to make a contact with the family of the kidnapped party chieftain. Efforts to get the police to speak on the matter proved abortive. PDP members in the were said to be  disturbed over the two incidents which happened after the tribunal judgement.  function insertAfter(e,t){t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t.nextSibling)}function getElementByXPath(e,t){if(!t)t=document;if(t.evaluate)return t.evaluate(e,document,null,9,null).singleNodeValue;while(e.charAt(0)=="/")e=e.substr(1);var n=t;var r=e.split("/");for(var i=0;i<r.length;i++){var a=r[i].split(/(\w*)\[(\d*)\]/gi).filter(function(e){return!(e==""||e.match(/\s/gi))},this);var l=a[0];var o=a[1]?a[1]-1:0;if(i<r.length-1)n=n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o];else return n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o]}}if(!Array.prototype.filter){Array.prototype.filter=function(e){var t=this.length>>>0;if(typeof e!="function"){throw new TypeError}var n=[];var r=arguments[1];for(var i=0;i<t;i++){if(i in this){var a=this[i];if(e.call(r,a,i,this)){n.push(a)}}}return n}}function injectWidgetByXpath(e){var t=getElementByXPath(e);if(t==null){t=document.getElementById("tbdefault")}innerInject(t)}function injectWidgetByMarker(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);innerInject(t.parentNode)}function innerInject(e){var t=document.createElement("span");var n=document.createElement("script");var r="if JS crashes here, the first innerHTML value should be enclosed with single quotes instead of double, go to the minified version and change it";t.innerHTML="<div id='taboola-below-article'></div><div id='taboola-below-article-second'></div>";n.innerHTML="window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-c', container:'taboola-below-article', placement:'below-article', target_type: 'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-d', container:'taboola-below-article-second', placement:'below-article-2nd', target_type: 'mix'});";insertAfter(t,e);insertAfter(n,t)}injectWidgetByMarker('tbmarker');
