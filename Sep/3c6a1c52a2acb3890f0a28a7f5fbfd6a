Wole Balogun, Ado Ekiti The Ekiti State Government has refuted the allegation from the People’s Democratic Party, (PDP), that  Justice Jide Aladejana who was recently named Chairman of the State Independent Electoral Commission(SIEC), was a dismissed judicial officer and not fit to hold such sensitive position. Information Commissioner Muyiwa Olumilua, yesterday said Aladejana  was only suspended and not dismissed by the National  Judicial Council (NJC) as claimed by the PDP. The commissioner said Aladejana was suspended following alleged complicity that trailed the impeachment of  the then governor, Ayo Fayose in 2006. He said during the imbroglio leading to Fayose’s impeachment in 2006, the then Friday Aderemi-led  House of Assembly, had suspended the Chief Judge of the State, Justice Kayode Bamisile  for allegedly hobnobbing with Fayose. The assembly  alleged the fraternity with  Fayose  had compromised the impeachment panel set up by Justice Bamisile to try Fayose over allegations of gross misconduct. Subsequently, Justice Aladejana was appointed in acting capacity to fill the vacancy, which the NJC said was a flagrant  violation of the laws and the principles of separation of powers. He was later suspended by the NJC.
