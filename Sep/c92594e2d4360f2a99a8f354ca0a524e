Fred Ezeh, Abuja A human rights and social justice organisation, Social Justice League (SJL), said on Friday, that some unnamed ‘big pastors’ were behind the alleged rape ordeal of the senior pastor, Commonwealth of Zion Assembly (COZA), Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo. Pastor Fatoyinbo was recently accused of rape by Busola Dakolo, the wife of popular Nigerian musician, Timi Dakolo. The group appealed to the pastors to desist from their ‘egoistic and evil’ ways fueled by jealousy and envy, or they would be exposed for the world to know their true identities. A statement jointly signed by the director and secretary of the organisation, Dr. Atta Ogah, and Bitrus Godwin, respectively, also accused the police of being partial in steps taken so far as regards the investigation. They said: “The Police appears to have compromised, or else, why should they subject Pastor Fatoyinbo to humiliation by searching his house in Abuja for an offence allegedly committed in Ilorin 20 years ago? Why should his international passport be seized? That he will run away?. “We are surprised that the complainant, Busola Dakolo, appears to be enjoying preferential treatment in the hands of the Police for a rather strange reason.” The group however confirmed that it has been monitoring the controversial issues and the Police handling of the case. It appealed to the Police not to make itself willing tools in the hands of external influences to pervert justice. It added: “Pastor Fatoyinbo is not a criminal but a mere suspect of a very controversial allegation, which is what the Police has a responsibility to find out, instead of treating the accused as a criminal. “We advise that the law should fully protect both the complainant and the accused, thus the unwarranted harassment and intimidation of Pastor Fatoyinbo by the Police should stop forthwith.”
