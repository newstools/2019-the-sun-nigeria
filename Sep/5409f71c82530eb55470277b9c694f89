Ultimately, investors lost about N40 billion as the market closed lower week-on-week (-0.3 per cent to 27,698.69 points) as significant selloffs of  heavyweights – Airtel Africa, offset gains in Stanbic IBTC, GT Bank and MTNN dragged the Year-to-Date (YTD) loss to 11.87 per cent.

Analysts believe the market will continue to see weak participation on the part of investors, but remained sure that confidence is gradually slipping into the market. Cordros Capital in their weekly note to Sunday Sun said: “Over the coming week, we expect the market to remain pressured given global risk-off sentiments and weak domestic participation.
Nonetheless, we note that valuations remain attractive while price deterioration has resulted in expected dividend yields on some stocks rising significantly to levels on par with yields on treasury bills. Hence, we advise that long-term investors consider appropriately timed investments”. On his part, Registrar/Chief Executive Officer, Institute of Capital Market Registrars, Dr David Ogogo, said: “Investors are hoping that they can rely on the legal system to take their disputes regarding their investments and then with the formation of the new advisory committee set up by the presidency bringing about a number of technocrats together, they believe that the decision taken would be good enough to take the economy to the desired level, this is thus fueling some kind of confidence in the economy and the impact is that it would positively affect investments decision also”.
