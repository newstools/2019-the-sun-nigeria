Ndubuisi Orji,  Abuja
The House of Representatives has said it will stop at nothing to get compensation for Nigerians,  who were victims of the recent xenophobic attacks in South Africa. 
The speaker,  Femi Gbajabiamila,  stated this in Abuja,  on Friday,  while speaking at a press conference.
Gbajabiamila equally  said the House would authorise sending for victims of the attacks,  who are interested in taking legal actions against identified perpetrators of the violence and their sponsors. According to him,  “the House of Representatives is united and determined in its resolve to meet our people at the point of their grievance and to channel their grievance into constructive action.
“Let no one be left in any doubt, we will seek, and we will obtain by whatever means available, due restoration and recompense for all that has been lost in this latest conflagration and all the ones that have come before it.
“We are committed to a sustained and special effort to see that the ends of justice are met for all our people who have suffered. We have heard the cries of our citizens, and we have witnessed their devastation. We will mourn for the dead, and cry for the lost, but we will not stop there.”
