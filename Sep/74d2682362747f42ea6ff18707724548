Aregbesola, while receiving the  Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufa’i, who paid him a visit, said states should complement the effort of the Federal Government and security establishments in combating crime.

He commended the Federal Government’s efforts towards restoring security along the Kaduna-Abuja Expressway.
