Egypt have appointed former Al Ahly player and coach Hossam El-Badry as manager to replace sacked Mexican Javier Aguirre, the country’s Football Association (FA) announced on its website. Aguirre was dismissed in July after The Pharaohs’ shock home elimination in the last 16 round of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) they hosted. The 59-year-old former Egypt defender has completed three stints as head coach of Cairo-based Al Ahly, starting in 2009 and most recently from 2016-18. He has also coached clubs in Sudan and Libya. El-Badry will be the first Egyptian to coach the national team since Shawky Gharib in 2014. Argentine Hector Cuper was Aguirre’s predecessor.(Reuters/NAN)
