The Youth and Sports Minister, Sunday Dare has commended the Nigerian U-23 national team, (Olympics team) for trashing the Sudanese national team 5-0 at the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba, Delta State, thereby qualifying for the African U-23 AFCON tournament slated for Egypt, November this year. The minister hailed the teamâ€™s stellar performance and that this is only possible by our acclaimed Nigerian spirit of doggedness and resilience to succeed in our endeavours. Overcoming the Sudanese by a 5-0 goal margin, according to Dare, made a resonating statement of the qualities our Olympics Champions are made of- purposeful team work, astute display of Skills and clinical finishing on the field of play. While commending the efforts of our players to clinch the ticket to play in the U-23 AFCON tournament in Egypt later this year and represent Africa in Tokyo Olympics 2020, the minister on behalf of President Muhammadu Buhari, wish the U-23 EAGLES best of luck in their next continental and intercontinental matches.
