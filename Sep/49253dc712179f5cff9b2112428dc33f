As part of its resolve to make Imo State the hub of ICT in the Southeast, the state government through the Office of the Imo First Lady, Ebere Ihedioha, yesterday gave out cash and gift items to 250 graduating women on ICT training sponsored by the state government.
The state governor, Emeka Ihedioha, who was represented by his Senior Special Assistant on Information and Advocacy, Adaora Oyenchere at the occasion, explained that the choice of women for the programme was to allow them access that had been denied them in the past.
Although he noted that the state government has a target of sponsoring 10,000 more men and women in the ICT training but added that it would be done gradually.
Participants according to the governor were drawn from across the 27 local government areas in the state.
At the end of the training 10 best graduating students were offered employment with cash of N100, 000 each and a laptop each.
One of the participants,Â  Ngozi Uche, thanked the state government for the opportunity, while promising to put the training to good use.
