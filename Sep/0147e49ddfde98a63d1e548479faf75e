Africa and Nigeria have become a destination of choice for investment by international companies that aim to seize the opportunities presented by the beauty and personal care markets. Presently, the market is put at an estimated $3 billion and its value is likely to rise to keep pace, with an increasing number of working women with disposable income as well as sophisticated youth searching for new ways to care for and present themselves. Strong population growth particularly of the young, urban, and female populations means beauty and personal care in Africa and Nigeria have plenty of scope for growth, especially in terms of exciting, new products. As part of the continent’s fast-growing middle class, young people are becoming more westernized through media exposure, and are expected to drive demand over the forecast period, according to Euromonitor.
