The awards ceremony is scheduled to hold in Lagos next month. Announcing the event in Lagos, the CEO/Founder of InstinctWave, Mr Akin Naphtal, said the awards is aimed at deepening growth in the finance sector by beaming lights on organisations, executives, teams and individuals that are driving the sector through innovative services and products. He noted that the financial sector plays a vital role in the economic development of the country, hence, it became imperative to recognise those whose outstanding leadership and practices have raised the standards of accountability within the ecosystem. He said some individuals who have showcased brilliancy in managing organisations’ wealth as well as promoting economic growth, will also be celebrated as the heroes and heroines of the sector. “The role of the financial sector and its importance to national development and growth cannot be underestimated, hence the need to reward those pushing boundaries in the public and private financial industry,” he said.
