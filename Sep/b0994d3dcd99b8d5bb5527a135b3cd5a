Noah Ebije, Kaduna After 15 days in captivity, Reverend Elisha Numan of Baptist Church, Ungwan Makere, Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna State has been set free by his abductors. Numan was abducted from his house by gunmen on Wednesday August 14, 2019 at about 2:00am, alongside his son, Emmanuel. However, the bandits later freed the son to go home and raise money for his father’s ransom. Confirming the release of the pastor in a telephone interview, the chairman of the Kaduna State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Reverend Joseph Hayab, on Sunday, called on the government and security agencies to do everything possible to address the increasing wave of kidnappings in Kaduna State. “Rev. Elisha Numan was released on Saturday night after two weeks in captivity. “He was released after a ransom was paid following a series of negotiations with the bandits on the ransom. “We thank God for His mercies; we pray for God’s intervention in the calamity that seemed to have befallen us as nation. “We will also continue to call on the government and the security agencies to do everything within their powers to stop the increasing rate of criminality across the country, especially the increasing wave of kidnappings in Kaduna,” Hayab said. However, family sources said the release of the clergyman followed a series of negotiations with the bandits who had initially demanded N20 million ransom. The source said Numan was released on Saturday evening after the payment of an undisclosed amount of money as ransom. “Our brother has been released by the kidnappers on Saturday evening after we paid the ransom. We have been in trauma since he was kidnapped on August 14, considering the fact that he was not even feeling well. “Since the security agencies seemed to be helpless in tackling these criminals, we can only pray to God to visit His wrath upon the criminals,” the source said. The source said the pastor returned home without any harm and was taken to the hospital for medical checks. Spokesman of the Kaduna State police command, DSP Yakubu Sabo, could not be reached for his reaction on the development as his mobile phone was not connecting.   function insertAfter(e,t){t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t.nextSibling)}function getElementByXPath(e,t){if(!t)t=document;if(t.evaluate)return t.evaluate(e,document,null,9,null).singleNodeValue;while(e.charAt(0)=="/")e=e.substr(1);var n=t;var r=e.split("/");for(var i=0;i<r.length;i++){var a=r[i].split(/(\w*)\[(\d*)\]/gi).filter(function(e){return!(e==""||e.match(/\s/gi))},this);var l=a[0];var o=a[1]?a[1]-1:0;if(i<r.length-1)n=n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o];else return n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o]}}if(!Array.prototype.filter){Array.prototype.filter=function(e){var t=this.length>>>0;if(typeof e!="function"){throw new TypeError}var n=[];var r=arguments[1];for(var i=0;i<t;i++){if(i in this){var a=this[i];if(e.call(r,a,i,this)){n.push(a)}}}return n}}function injectWidgetByXpath(e){var t=getElementByXPath(e);if(t==null){t=document.getElementById("tbdefault")}innerInject(t)}function injectWidgetByMarker(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);innerInject(t.parentNode)}function innerInject(e){var t=document.createElement("span");var n=document.createElement("script");var r="if JS crashes here, the first innerHTML value should be enclosed with single quotes instead of double, go to the minified version and change it";t.innerHTML="<div id='taboola-below-article'></div><div id='taboola-below-article-second'></div>";n.innerHTML="window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-c', container:'taboola-below-article', placement:'below-article', target_type: 'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-d', container:'taboola-below-article-second', placement:'below-article-2nd', target_type: 'mix'});";insertAfter(t,e);insertAfter(n,t)}injectWidgetByMarker('tbmarker');
