Anthony Joshua has claimed “sometimes the ones who are calm and chilled can bark”, when speaking about Andy Ruiz during a press conference in London on Friday. The Briton also rated Ruiz as “the best heavyweight out there”. Both boxers went face to face in London, as their three-day press tour ended, ahead of their December 7 rematch in Saudi Arabia. Asked about again being a challenger to the world heavyweight championships, Joshua said: “It’s a great mindset to have and you can’t lose that. The minute you lose it, you’ve got to retire. You’ve got to be hungry. “I had a blip. We go again. I’m not shy. No fear.” Joshua said about his upcoming opponent who took his IBF, WBA and WBO belts earlier this year: “Ruiz Jr is calm but he can fight. He is not a fake character who puts on a persona. “Sometimes the ones who are calm and chilled can bark back, and can definitely fight.”(NAN)
