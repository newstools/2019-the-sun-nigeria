Sylvanus Viashima, Jalingo Following the judgement of the tribunal reaffirming the election of Governor Darius Ishaku in the last governorship election in the state, party faithful from both the People’s Democratic Party PDP and the All Progressives Congress APC have reacted to the judgement. The speaker Taraba State House of Assembly, Mr. Peter Abel Diah, who described the judgement as expected, said the victory would give the governor more confidence and time to concentrate on delivering good governance for the people of the state.
