Highlighting the company’s commitment towards waste management practices, the Executive Director of Ampak Nigeria Limited – Mrs. Kemi Ajakaiye, in her opening address to volunteers and participants present at the event emphasized that waste collection and disposal is just one fraction of the enormous yet crucial responsibility of managing the environment.

Mrs. Kemi Ajakaiye commended the management of LAWMA, who graced the event with fifteen (15) representatives, for their relentless efforts in working towards a cleaner and healthier Lagos and presented LAWMA with cleaning tools (rakes, scrubbing brushes, hand-gloves, nose mask and trash bags) as a gesture to support their efforts. The cleanup exercise is specifically driven by three of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – Good Health and Well Being (Goal 3); Clean Water and Sanitation (Goal 6) and Sustainable Cities and Communities (Goal11).
