Esther may be out of the Big Brother Naija house, but she’s not out of the minds of her now former housemates. Current co-Heads of House and lovebirds, Mercy and Ike, still have some spicy words to share about Esther, as portrayed in the latest episode of Showmax’s Extra View. During a discussion between Mercy and Ike, the former revealed that Esther had played a fast one on Diane over Nelson. Fans of the show will recall that Nelson, a former housemate, had been a love interest of BFFs Esther and Diane while he was in the house. “We were talking about who we like in the house and Diane told Esther that she likes Nelson, and the next two days she (Esther) took Nelson,” Mercy told Ike. Continuing she said: “Diane told me she didn’t see Tuoyo as a boyfriend; I like Tuoyo different. I have feelings for this person (Nelson) and she made it very clear, she didn’t hide it. Then the day we had this discussion, it was still Esther who asked us who she (Diane) liked. She didn’t want to, but Diane just said it and the next thing you (Esther) are with this guy and we don’t even know what happened”. Mercy further revealed that Esther didn’t state that she liked Nelson during the discussion, leading Ike to describe Esther as a “sneaky girl”. During his last days in the house, Nelson shared more than a few cuddly moments with Esther, an action, which Mercy has now revealed affected Diane badly.
