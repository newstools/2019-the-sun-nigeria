Egba, who claimed to have been a subpoenaed witness for the defeated governorship candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC) could not produce an authorization to represent the Police.
Following questions raised by defendant counsels, Egba abandoned the results and fled the court premises.
No attempt was made by police personnel in the court premises to arrest him.
