The Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr Godwin Emefiele says about 1.2 billion dollars worth of fish is imported into Nigeria annually. Emefiele disclosed this in a meeting while briefing some state governors and the media on the feat recorded so far in agriculture for economic growth, in Abuja on Thursday. He explained that current fish production stood at 0.8 million tons while the demand was 2.7 million tons, giving a deficit of 1.9 million tons. He said the apex bank’s current initiative was to engage the coastal state governors to develop the blue economy to address the deficit of 1.9metric tons as well as eradicate the huge import bill for fish. According to him, this is a very huge economic opportunity for the states to create an enabling environment for investors.
