The Nigerian Army says there is observed massive exodus of Boko Haram and Islamic State of West Africa Province terrorists out of their hideout in Lake Chad Tumbus to North and Central Africa sub-regions. Col. Sagir Musa, acting Director, Army Public Relations, disclosed this in a statement in Abuja, yesterday. Musa said the combined onslaught by the troops of Nigerian Army and Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) in the region on identified hideouts of terrorist was responsible for their exodus. He said there were credible reports from reliable sources indicating massive movements of criminal groups out of the area towards Sudan and Central African Republic. This mass movement for their lives was necessitated by  the sustained air and artillery bombardments by the Nigerian Armed Forces and Coalition forces of the MNJTF, which killed uncountable number of the terrorists and destroyed their weapons and equipment, he said. The army spokesperson disclosed that the various national troops and the MNJTF were maintaining aggressive patrols and blocking positions against infiltration by the escaping criminals. He said it was important to note that most of the Tumbus were located along the Quadrangular borders of Cameroon, Chad, Niger Republic and Nigeria. “To further annihilate the fleeing terrorists, efforts are ongoing for continued shelling, bombardment and pursuits. “Similarly, the countries in these sub-regions have also been contacted through the MNJTF headquarters,” he said.
