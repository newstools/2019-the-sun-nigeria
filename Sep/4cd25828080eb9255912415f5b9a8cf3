Fred Ezeh, Abuja Some medical doctors at Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Asaba, Delta state, may lose their licence soon if convicted of negligence or other professional misconduct that resulted in the death of Rita Uchebuego. Rita was said to have died during childbirth in March 2018, as a result of alleged negligence and professional misconduct by some medical doctors in the hospital. The deceased family members reported the incident to Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MDCN) for investigation and prosecution of the doctors for alleged negligence and professional misconduct. The doctors (names withheld) are being tried by MDCN disciplinary tribunal headed by Prof. Abba Waziri Hassan. Some other doctors that were allegedly involved in the death of the Rita appeared before the tribunal at its previous sitting in Abuja. Chairman of the MDCN tribunal, Prof. Waziri, in his remarks assured the doctors that the tribunal was not out to witch-hunt or ridicule anybodyâ€™s career, but to give opportunity to the accused persons to explain themselves, thus giving the tribunal bases for judgement. While some of the accused doctors appeared in person, others were represented by their counsels.
