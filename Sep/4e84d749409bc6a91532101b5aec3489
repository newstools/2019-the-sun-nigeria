Chommisky sweetie This alluring enduring figure of eight For whom my importuning prays to be her Mate Am I not a prisoner of her silky Looks? Me who does not play by the books Her height, an iroko tree, reaching to the sky As tall as her ambition so high As her steps, like wacko jacko’s, waltz Calyco dance So, vain swains want to take their chance Isn’t she a sweet orange peeling off her rind? Showing enormous mountainous behind This exquisite rara avis a great find And images of her filling my mind Her paw-paws, erect like an Aryan nose, Red-ful Suckling lives youngish-old a mouthful Kissing silks rhythmically Heaving, like agama lizard, musically Her nature’s fur smooth to my touch Tingling tickling my senses so much Its colour the velvety brown The sight of which drowns my dolour And frown Behold her divinely finely visage Today’s Romeos very rage Not blemished by fast travelling age In the visage a prototype of African nose With her lips opening and closing like flower rose And the dentition so bright and white Like Europe’s snow’s bite Breaking into frothy toothy smile As we walk our earth’s tortuous mile An angel of grace The regal legal queen of our place A specimen true of the race Who keeps the pace in our space What a companionable staff she’s in troubled time With whom like clock our hearts chime Garlanding my temple with handsome advice That repels like bullet proof vests my vices The therapy of her jokes Fill my being to feel like coke That lifts me to mount ecstasy Where I fly and ply the trade of fantasy
