  TONY JOHN, Port Harcourt A Federal High Court in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, has restrained the National Assembly (NASS) from taking over the legislative functions of the Edo State House of Assembly, saying that it lacks the power to do so. The court has also declared that the National Assembly does not have the power to order the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, to make a fresh proclamation on the House of Assembly, insisting that it (Edo House of Assembly) is not NASS’ appendage. Delivering the judgement, Justice Kolawole Omotosho stated that it was only the court that has the prerogative power to issue such a directive and not NASS. Justice Omotosho maintained that the Edo State Governor, Obaseki, fulfilled the constitutional right before making the proclamation on the House of Assembly. He also added that since the proclamation on June 17, 2019, the House of Assembly had carried out its legislative functions, stressing that the governor’s proclamation should not be tampered with. He stated: “As long as it is concerned, the Edo State governor has the power to make the proclamation. He has made the proclamation as empowered by the constitution. “The governor is the chief executive of the state as enshrined in the constitution and he cannot be mandated by the National Assembly. “The proclamation remains valid, and the validity remains unchallenged. This court will not allow the proclamation to be tampered with by any National Assembly process. The order by the National Assembly is frowned upon and should not be encouraged,” Omotosho stated. The plaintiffs, Yekini Idiaye (Deputy Speaker)  and Henry Okhuarobo, member representing Ikpoba-Okha constituency, had among other prayers,  urged the court stop NASS for taking over the legislative functions of the Edo State House of Assembly. Speaking shortly after the judgement, Gov. Obaseki’s lawyer, Santos Owolori, said: “The judgement is sound and it is a beauty for democracy.” Counsel for the plaintiffs, Kingsley Idahosa, said: “It is a beauty for democracy and it would shape the law.” Also, lawyer for NASS, Osinachi Sandra, simply said it was a judgement for democracy.  function insertAfter(e,t){t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t.nextSibling)}function getElementByXPath(e,t){if(!t)t=document;if(t.evaluate)return t.evaluate(e,document,null,9,null).singleNodeValue;while(e.charAt(0)=="/")e=e.substr(1);var n=t;var r=e.split("/");for(var i=0;i<r.length;i++){var a=r[i].split(/(\w*)\[(\d*)\]/gi).filter(function(e){return!(e==""||e.match(/\s/gi))},this);var l=a[0];var o=a[1]?a[1]-1:0;if(i<r.length-1)n=n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o];else return n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o]}}if(!Array.prototype.filter){Array.prototype.filter=function(e){var t=this.length>>>0;if(typeof e!="function"){throw new TypeError}var n=[];var r=arguments[1];for(var i=0;i<t;i++){if(i in this){var a=this[i];if(e.call(r,a,i,this)){n.push(a)}}}return n}}function injectWidgetByXpath(e){var t=getElementByXPath(e);if(t==null){t=document.getElementById("tbdefault")}innerInject(t)}function injectWidgetByMarker(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);innerInject(t.parentNode)}function innerInject(e){var t=document.createElement("span");var n=document.createElement("script");var r="if JS crashes here, the first innerHTML value should be enclosed with single quotes instead of double, go to the minified version and change it";t.innerHTML="<div id='taboola-below-article'></div><div id='taboola-below-article-second'></div>";n.innerHTML="window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-c', container:'taboola-below-article', placement:'below-article', target_type: 'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-d', container:'taboola-below-article-second', placement:'below-article-2nd', target_type: 'mix'});";insertAfter(t,e);insertAfter(n,t)}injectWidgetByMarker('tbmarker');
