The Eze Ndigbo Thailand in Mekong River Asia, HRH Eze (amb) Uzochukwu  Jerome Ezeneche has condemned  the Xenophobic  attack on Nigerians in South Africa even as he calls on The African Union and the United Nations to intervene before the crisis  escalates. In a statement made available to Daily Sun, Ezeneche  described  the worrisome development  as  setback to recent African Charter on Free trade. While commending The Federal Government on measures taken so far to arrest the situation, the royal father urges restrain on the part of protesters as hoodlums are already hijacking the situation to loot and vandalise South African investment in Nigeria. While also calling on South African authorities  to restore  order in affected provinces, Ezeneche said both countries  stand to lose if the tit for tat  attitude continues. Going down memories lane,  Ezeneche recalled that Nigeria in the 70s played pivotal  role in bringing to an end apartheid  during the time of  white minority rule in South Africa. On long-term solution to immigration of Nigerians abroad for greener pasture, the Igbo leader urges the Federal Government to address problem of power, insecurity and unemployment adding that if all this measure are in place, the numbers of Nigerians  travelling  abroad to eke out a living, would drastically  reduce.
