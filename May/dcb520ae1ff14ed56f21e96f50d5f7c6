Manchester City have claimed the joint-biggest win ever in FA Cup final history with a 6-0 drubbing of Watford. Raheem Sterling scored the first FA Cup final hat-trick since 1953 as Manchester City rounded off an outstanding season by crushing Watford at Wembley to clinch a historic domestic treble. Sterling was the star of the show as Pep Guardiola’s team became the first English men’s team to achieve the feat of winning the Premier League, FA Cup and Carabao Cup in the same season. Gabriel Jesus scored twice as well with David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne providing the other goals in the rout. City now share the record for the highest margin of victory with Bury, who also won 6-0 against Derby in the 1903 FA Cup final. Heurelho Gomes needed to make a superb last-gasp save to deny John Stones and ensure another record did not topple at the hands of City. It will however offer Watford little consolation after Javi Gracia’s men failed in their quest to cause an upset. The Hornets were outplayed for large portions but may feel that the scoreline did not represent a true reflection of the match. Kevin De Bruyne also got his name on the scoresheet as City completed domestic treble Watford had their moments, the best of which fell to Roberto Pereyra in the first half with the score still goalless, but the midfielder failed to find a way past Ederson from close. They also had a good shout for a penalty turned down before Silva provided a clever finish on the volley to open the scoring. Sterling, controversially, hammered into an empty net after Jesus’ effort appeared to be creeping over the line – the goal was later confirmed as the Brazilian’s. De Bruyne rounded Gomes to make it three before Jesus and a quickfire Sterling double added gloss to the scoreline.
