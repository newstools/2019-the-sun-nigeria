Liverpool will be without forwards Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino when they face Barcelona in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final as they look to overturn a 3-0 deficit, Manager Juergen Klopp said on Monday. Egypt international Salah was carried off the pitch with a head injury in Saturday’s 3-2 Premier League win at Newcastle United and has not recovered for the game against Barca at Anfield on Tuesday. Brazilian Firmino has a muscular injury and was not included in the squad for Saturday’s game at St James’ Park. “They both are not available for tomorrow (Tuesday),” Klopp told a news conference. “It’s a concussion for Mo. He would not be allowed to play. He feels Ok but it’s not good enough from a medical point of view. He’s desperate but we cannot do it.” (Reuters/NAN)
