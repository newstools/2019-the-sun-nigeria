Iran judiciary says an Iranian national has been sentenced to 10 years on charges of spying for Britain. Monday’s report by the semi-official ISNA news agency quoted the spokesman of the judiciary, Gholamhossein Esmaili, as saying the suspect worked for the British Council and cooperated with Britain’s intelligence. Esmaili did not identify the suspect by name or gender. He said the suspect was sentenced after “clearly confessing to assignments with the British intelligence.” A British-Iranian woman held in Tehran, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, is serving a five-year prison sentence for allegedly planning the “soft toppling” of Iran’s government while traveling with her young daughter. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who works for the charity arm of Thomson Reuters, was arrested in April 2016. Her sentence has been widely criticized.
