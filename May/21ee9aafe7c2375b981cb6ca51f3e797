Analysts remain hopeful that the bulls will return to the market and added that the reappointment of Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, Mr Godwin Emefiele, for a final term of five years by President Muhammadu Buhari, would bring stability to the nation’s financial system. Chairman, Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), Abuja Chapter, Prof Uche Uwaleke, described the re-nomination of Emefiele as a good omen for the capital market. Uwaleke, who is the Head of Banking and Finance Department, Nasarawa State University, added: “It is one development that speaks to policy consistency and will further consolidate macroeconomic stability, especially with respect to exchange rate and inflation. “Investors, both domestic and foreign can have some degree of confidence in the direction of monetary policy, which is positive for the capital market. One thing is now certain: that the interventions by the CBN in critical sectors of the economy especially agriculture and non-agric-based SMEs will continue. “These will rub off positively on economic recovery efforts especially now that the CBN under Emefiele has signaled an accommodative monetary policy stance. It is equally positive for financial systems stability.” However, Cordros Capital in an emailed note dated May 9, said, “in the absence of a positive catalyst, we guide investors to trade cautiously in the short term. However, stable macroeconomic fundamentals and compelling valuation remain supportive of recovery in the mid-to-long term”.
