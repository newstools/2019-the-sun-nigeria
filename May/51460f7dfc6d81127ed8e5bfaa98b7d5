Fred Itua, Abuja Hundreds of youth on the platform of the North West wing of Coalition of Northern Youth Organisation, have organised a peaceful rally, calling on Danjuma Goje to declare for the Senate presidency of the 9th National Assembly. The youth carrying various banners including, “Goje for 9th Senate,”, “Goje best for next level,” among others, described him as the most qualified senator to occupy the office. They also visited the North West zonal secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kaduna, where they presented a letter supporting Goje’s candidature. Chairman of the group, Hassan Idris, said the group would not accept any unfair endorsement of candidates from the North East region.
