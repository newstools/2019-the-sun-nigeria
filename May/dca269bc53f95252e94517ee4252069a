Nigerian veteran actress and producer, Eucharia Anunobi, has advised those going through depression not to consider suicide as an option. The 53-year-old actress turned pastor came into stardom for her role in the movie series, Glamour Girls (1994) and went on to star in over 90 movies including Abuja Connection (2004) and Letters to a Stranger (2007). Anunobi gave the advice by posting a solemn video on her official Instagram page. She captioned it: “I don’t know who you are and where you are now watching this video. PLEASE SUICIDE IS NOT AN OPTION. “I stand on the finished work of Jesus Christ and command the spirit of depression to lose its hold over you now.” In 2017, Anunobi lost her only son, 15-year-old Raymond, to complications from sickle cell anemia. The video had her recounting the loss of her son whom she described as her best friend on numerous occasions. “I want to let you know that I also feel what you’re feeling; I want you to use me as a point of contact. “I lost my only son and everyone practically deserted me. I haven’t given up; I want to tell you not to give up. “All will be well, suicide is not an option it’s a sin against God,” the evangelist said. Some other movies she had featured in include: Sacred Heart (2007), When you are mine (2007), Joy of a Mother (2006), Miss Nigeria (2004). (NAN)
