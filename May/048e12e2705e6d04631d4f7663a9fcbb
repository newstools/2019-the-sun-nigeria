An explosion inside a mosque in the east of Kabul has left one dead and wounded another 16, the Afghan Ministry of Interior Affairs said. The person killed was a cleric named Mawlawi Raihan, ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi said. Why and how the explosion took place in the mosque has yet to be determined, said Ferdous Faramarz, a spokesman for the Kabul police chief. The area was cordoned off while police investigation is under way, Faramarz said. (dpa/NAN)
