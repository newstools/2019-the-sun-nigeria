A man who was abandoned as a baby at Gatwick Airport more than 30 years ago has tracked down his parents. Steve Hydes was left in the airport’s south terminal in 1986 when he was just 10 days old and was found wrapped in a blanket in the women’s toilets. Hydes has spent 15 years trying trace his family and now, after genealogists tested DNA samples, has discovered that his mother passed away but his father is still alive. Hydes’ story made national newspaper headlines and he was known as ‘Gary Gatwick’ after the teddy bear mascot of the Sussex airport. The 33-year-old, who has no ill feelings towards his parents, wanted to trace his family so he could learn more about his background which he could pass on to his own two children. After making contact with his father, Hydes found he had siblings who did not know he existed. Hydes, 33, wrote on Facebook: “Some good news. After 15 years of searching, I am happy to confirm that with the very hard work of the Genetic Genealogists, CeCe Moore and Helen Riding we have been able to trace and confirm my birth family. “Unfortunately, my mum has passed away so I am unable to find out exactly what happened and why. However I have found my birth father and siblings on both sides,  who were all unaware of my existence.” After he was abandoned, Hydes was placed in foster care before being adopted by a family in which he grew up with three sisters. His search was dealt a blow when he discovered police had destroyed the files on his case that included details of a phone call made to officers from a young woman claiming to be his mother. The woman, from Hounslow, west London, said she would look after the child and that his name was Michael. Hyde has spent years appearing in newspaper articles and documentaries trying to trace his family. He added: “As you can imagine this is quite a sensitive issue to all involved and very new to us all, but I wanted to take this time to thank everyone for their continued support over the years.
