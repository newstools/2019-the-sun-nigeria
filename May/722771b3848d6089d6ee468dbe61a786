The letter was addressed to the Speaker and members of the state House of Assembly. It reads in part: “As you already know ,I have been sent to another four years mission by my federal constituency ,nay Imo state, at the federal House of Representatives, Abuja.” “This new task has come with its own challenges and expectations, especially need to play key roles in the formation of the National Assembly leadership, and time to strategically position,to pursue the greater interests of Imo state, South East and Nigeria, at the federal legislature. Currently, these will make my availability in Imo state irregular.” “Hence, I seek your undertaking as I either save the office of Imo state Deputy speaker by resigning or allow my new engagements to suffer the office of Imo state Deputy speaker by holding same tenaciously.” “Thus, for your efficiency and good of Imo people, I hereby resign as the Rt Hon. deputy speaker of Imo state House of Assembly (8th House), effective from the date written above.”
