He said: “I am here for the celebration of the victory of our brother, governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, for a second term. “I am happy to be part of this great victory of Governor Wike and the good people of Rivers State. This was one of the toughest elections and the people stood by the governor in defence of democracy. “We are here to celebrate what they fought for.  For those, who lost their lives, we are here to show that it was not in vain. I congratulate the governor and the people of Rivers State for this victory,”  Senate President said.
