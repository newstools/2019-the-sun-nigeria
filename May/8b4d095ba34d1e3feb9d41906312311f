Mao Qun’an, a director of the National Health Commission, said at the second Digital China Summit that 19 provinces, or over half of China’s provincial-level regions, had established provincial tele-medicine platforms. The central government has also earmarked 99 million U.S. dollars in special funds to add tele-medical and other equipment in primary-level health institutions in impoverished counties. The commission is now working to realise online services in second and tertiary hospitals, he said. China’s has a three-tier hospital grading system with the tertiary being the highest. Internet hospitals refer to those offering medical services, such as consultation and diagnosis, online.
