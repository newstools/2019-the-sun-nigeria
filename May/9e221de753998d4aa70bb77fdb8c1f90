Gabriel Dike Lagos State University (LASU) Vice Chancellor, Prof. Olanrewaju Fagbohun, yesterday disclosed that the institution will graduate 57 First Class students during the forthcoming convocation of the institution on Thursday, May 16. 
Fagbohun, who told newsmen that the number is the highest in the history of the 36 years old institution, said last year, the university produced 26 First Class and less in 2017.

“Never in the history of the Lagos State University have we had it so good. Two graduands, Ridwan Oladotun Ola-Gbadamosi from the Faculty of Engineering and Nneka Karen Enumah of the Faculty of Sciences graduated with a CGPA of 4.88 to emerge as the best graduating students.”
