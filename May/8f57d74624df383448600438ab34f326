The National Industrial Court, Abuja, on Thursday threatened to strike out a suit filed by the former Chief Judge of Abia, Justice Kalu Amah (rtd), challenging non-payment of entitlements. At the last adjourned date, the first defence counsel, Izu Omokwe had informed the court that an out of court settlement was on going. Omokwe said that the State Attorney-General had written to the Chief Judge for computation of the claimant’s entitlements. However, at the resumed sitting on Thursday, Izu urged the court to strike out the matter for lacking in diligent prosecution on the part of the claimant. She said the claimant’s counsel had failed on several occasions to show up for deliberation for parties to explore out of court settlement.
