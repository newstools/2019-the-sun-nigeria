Osinbajo, who was represented by the Special Adviser to the President on Political Affairs, Senator Babafemi Ojudu, explained that the Federal Government, under the present administration, is desirous of bridging the digital divide. “We understand the challenges of deploying infrastructure that drive access to telecommunications services to very wide geographical locations in Nigeria. We are also aware of the security challenges that face different economic activities in some parts of the country, which may have led to disruption of services, and in some cases, led to attendant destruction of infrastructure. But we will continue to put in our best efforts to ensure that we contain these challenges,” he said. He noted that the Federal Government is proud of the performance of NCC in its sustained democratisation of access to telecommunications services and maintaining stability in the sector. “With 174 million connected lines, 116 million access to the internet, and current broadband penetration at 33.22 per cent, the impact on lifestyles, businesses, and social interactions, has continued to improve.
