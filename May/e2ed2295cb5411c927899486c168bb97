Godwin Tsa, Abuja The police authorities have arraigned the governorship candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Osun State, Senator Ademola Adeleke, before a Magistrate Court in Abuja over alleged forgery. In the fresh five-count charge, the police accused Adeleke of forging a letter of attestation and result from Muslim Grammar School, Ede Osun State. He was, however, admitted to bail in the sum of N2 million and a surety by Muhammed Suberu of the Mpape Magistrate Court, Abuja, after entering a plea of not guilty. The prosecution alleged that the senator submitted the said forged documents to the Independent National Electoral Commission as PDP’s candidate in the said governorship election. The magistrate ruled that the surety must reside within the jurisdiction of the court. He was equally granted permission to travel to the United States of America on Tuesday (today) for medical treatment. The police is also prosecuting senator Adeleke (Osun West) and four others before a Federal High Court in Abuja over alleged examination malpractices. In a four-count charge filed in the name of the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Adeleke is accused of fraudulently registering as students of Ojo-Aro Community Grammar School, Ojo-Aro, Osun State to enable them sit for the National Examination Council (NECO) examination of June/July 2017.
