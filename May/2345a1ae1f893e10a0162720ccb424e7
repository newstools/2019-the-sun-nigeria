Okoh with his management team for conceiving and implementing the projects within three months. While nothing that the gesture by the Bureau has greatly enhanced the aesthetics of the school and given the pupils a conducive environment to learn, she said that BPE has undoubtedly provided the template of how government agencies could touch the lives of pupils and the less privileged  in the society; and called on other agencies to emulate the Bureau. Pledging to secure the facilities   provided by the Bureau for the school, she appealed to the paramount ruler of the area to provide security to the school to safeguard the facilities.
