Others include abused and exploitation as prostitutes among othersl. Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, who spoke at a media dialogue to mark the  anniversary,  maintained that Federal Government had repeatedly shown commitment to the rights of Nigerian children through friendly policies and programmes. The minister,  who was represented by the ministry’s head of Child Rights Information Bureau (CRIB), Olumide Osanyipeju, confessed that CRC had been of great help to the rights and protection of the children. “CRC set out civil, political, economic, social, health and cultural rights of children, of which Nigeria is part of. For us, the need to uphold the realisation of the rights of children can never be over emphasized.” he said.
