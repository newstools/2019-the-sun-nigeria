Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri  All might not be well with ex-Imo deputy speaker, Ugonna Ozuruigbo, who recently resigned his position and membership of the Imo State House of Assembly to focus attention on his new duty as the House of Representative member-elect for Isu/Nkwere/Nwangele and Njaba. Right now, Ozuruigbo is battling to clear himself from the petition written to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) by candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Kingsley Echendu, over All Progressives Congress (APC’s) primary election in the constituency which he claimed never was. In the petition addressed to the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Francis Ezeonu, and the Department of  Security Services (DSS) in the state, Echendu who came behind Ozuruigbo of the APC reminded INEC that two aspirants of APC were claiming to have been issued nomination forms by their party. He noted that Harrison Nwadike and Mrs. Doris Akugbuo, both aspirants from APC as Ozuruigbo, were claiming to have been nominated by their party. They have taken the matter to the Federal High Court, Owerri, challenging the candidature of Ozuruigbo. Echendu is therefore, claiming that since the matter was unresolved before the two aggrieved APC aspirants went to court, Ozuruigbo’s purported election never was.
