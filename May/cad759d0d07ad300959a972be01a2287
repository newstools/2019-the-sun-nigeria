Chairman, House Committee on Appropriations, Mustapha Dawaki, told journalists that the budget will be transmitted to the president tomorrow for his assent. “We were told to pass the budget by end of March but we couldn’t do that because Ministers and head of agencies were not coming forward to defend their proposals,”  he claimed. The budget is expected to run for 12 months from the day it is assented to . Dawaki, who gave highlight of the budget at a press briefing, said the parliament adopted the oil benchmark and exchange rate as proposed by the executive arm of government. He explained that the National Assembly had scheduled to pass the budget in March, but most of the MDAs did not comply with the timetable for the defence of their budget estimates. According to him, “the proposal that was sent to the National Assembly, there are two components of the budget; we have the benchmark for crude oil production and the exchange rate. The National Assembly sustained all these items the way they were sent by the President. The oil benchmark projection was 2.3 million barrel per day. The exchange rate was proposed at N305 per dollar and the National Assembly sustained it.  We also sustained the 60 dollar per per barrel oil benchmark. We did not change anything with regard to the executive proposal.” The Appropriations Committee chairman said the only area that was touched was the deficit. “The fiscal deficit when it was sent to us was N1.906 trillion. However, as it is now, there is an increase of 53billion on the deficit. Reason is that there were so many outstanding items that were not captured in the 2019 budget proposal. There was a resolution in the Senate that urged the Federal Government to intervene in the security situation in Zamfara. N10 billion was approved for special intervention. “There is also severance benefit for outgoing legislators and legislative aides, which was not captured in the 2019 budget proposal. These expenses are always happening in the transition year. When legislators are exiting and new ones are coming in, we have to make provision fo that which amounted to N26.4 billion.” There is also salaries for legislative aides that have not been “paid for four years, for which N3 billion was provided to pay them.” Thee was also addition to the security agencies generally, because of what is happening in the country. We believe that providing more funds for them will make them discharge the constitutional responsibilities diligently.These are areas the National Assembly intervened.These things are captured under the service wide vote.”
