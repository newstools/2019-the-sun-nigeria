The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has announced temporary closure of only the Ibadan-bound carriage way of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway from Magboro to Kara and Ibafo. FRSC Commander in Ogun, Clement Oladele, made this known in a statement made available to newsmen in Abeokuta, yesterday. Oladele said that the closure took effect yesterday, and that the road would be re-opened on Friday, to enable the contracting firm, Julius Berger Nigeria PLC, lay asphalt on that section of the road. “This is to inform the motoring public that Julius Berger Nigeria PLC, currently rehabilitating the Lagos – Ibadan Expressway, will be temporarily closing only the Ibadan bound carriageway from Magboro to Kara and Ibafo. “It is scheduled to commence from Wednesday, May 22, 2019 and re-opened on Friday, May 24, 2019. “The temporary closure is to lay a section of 400 metres of wearing asphaltic surface on the affected section of the corridor. “The closure will not affect traffic inbound Lagos around the affected road but will narrow the carriageway which is expected to build up traffic around the mentioned sections,’’ he said. The sector commander advised motorists to note the occurrence and plan their trips, and added that those using the corridor, within the period, should obey all traffic rules and regulations. Oladele urged motorists to refrain from driving against traffic. He said  violators are liable to be apprehended for dangerous driving, which attracts a fine of N50, 000 and impounding of the erring vehicle. “The FRSC is working with sister traffic agencies to maintain visibility, to ease the traffic discomfort the temporary closure of that section of the corridor would cause,’’ he said.
