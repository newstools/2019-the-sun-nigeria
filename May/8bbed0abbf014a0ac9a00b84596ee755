Lukman Olabiyi The Nigeria Navy has failed to produce detained Lagos based hotelier in court as ordered by Justice Lilian Ijeoma Ojukwu. Justice Ojukwu of the Federal High Court Abuja, had  on April 17, while granting an ex-parte application, ordered the officers of the Nigeria Navy to appear before her and explain why they failed to arraign Saibu Ogunmola, the Chairman/Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Peace and Love International Hotel, who has been in their custody since January 17. Other respondents also affected by the order are the Chief of Naval Staff, the Commander NNS Beecroft, Apapa, Lagos, and the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA), Abuja. At the resumed hearing of the matter, it was only the fourth respondent (DIA),  through its counsel, C. O. Abodunde that appeared before the court, while the first, second and third respondents had no legal representation. Following the absence of the first to third respondents, lawyer to the hotelier, McAnthony Aikharialea told the court that with the look of things, the respondents have disobeyed the order of the honourable court which was made on April 17, and served on all respondents. However, counsel to DIA, Abodunde, told the court that the Nigeria Navy, after the order, had  come to move the applicant from their custody with a concluded arrangement to hand him over to prosecuting government’s agency any moment from now. But, the hotelier’s lawyer contended that the absence of the first to third respondents, and their inability to bring the applicant to court as ordered by the court was contemptuous,. He informed the court of his readiness to commence contempt proceeding against the respondents . After listening to submission of parties, Justice Ojukwu adjourned  the matter till May 15. He  urged  the applicant’s counsel to ensure that hearing notice on the main suit was issued and served on time on the first to third respondents.
