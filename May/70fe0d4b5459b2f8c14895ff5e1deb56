Chinelo Obogo  A pan-Yoruba political group, the Yoruba Youth Movement (YYM), has endorsed Emeka Nwajiuba as Speaker of the ninth House of Representatives. In a media statement signed by its chairman, Kola Kayode, the YYM said it decided on Nwajiuba in the interest of balancing the equation among the six geo-political zones of the country. The group also said its decision was in consideration of loyalty and experience in which it rated Nwajiuba as first among equals. “If we look at it religiously, you will see that a southern Christian is what is needed to balance the scales in the ninth House of Representatives,” the group said. According to the YYM, between 2015 and now, the South East has doubled its votes in national elections,” and so the distribution of the positions of principal officers of the House of Representatives should reflect national unity, balance and cohesion, with the South East having the speakership slot.

It added: “Beyond his consistent loyalty to the president, he was a key factor in the APC constitution-drafting committee and much later a ranking member of the House of Rep between 1999 and 2003.”
