Their emergence has come at a time when our democracy needs men with proven track record of progressive leadership and experience. Dr. Fayemi is a technocrat and development expert with a rich wealth of experience over the years and I am confident that he will galvanise the NGF to work with President Muhammadu Buhari to take the nation to the next level. Meanwhile, the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), comprising all state governors elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has elected the governor of Kebbi State, Atiku Bagudu, as its new chairman.
