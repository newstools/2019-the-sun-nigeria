(Xinhua/NAN) The number of registered nurses in China exceeded 4 million at the end of 2018, rising to 3 nurses per 1,000 people, the National Health Commission announced on Wednesday. Registered nurses make up nearly 50 per cent of the countryâ€™s healthcare professionals, said Jiao Yahui, an official with the commission, at a press conference ahead of International Nurses Day, which falls on May 12. The nursing services have been improved as a growing number of medical staff now have expertise, Jiao said. He added that almost 70 per cent of nurses hold junior college degrees or above.
