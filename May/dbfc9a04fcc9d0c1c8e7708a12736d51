Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr will travel to the United Kingdom to hold talks with Nigeria captain John Obi Mikel ahead of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.
For one reason or another, the Chelsea legend has not featured for the national team since his last appearance against Argentina on June 26 at the 2018 World Cup, and the German hopes to convince the midfielder to return to the Super Eagles for his last Africa Cup of Nations.
Speaking to BBC, Rohr said: ‘‘this is the question that my team and I will resolve. I will soon go to see him at Middlesbrough.
“There are many things to consider, but I respect him and what he has done for Nigeria. He remains an important player.’’
The German added: ‘’He has been away from the team for a year, but we qualified for the AFCON without him. His absence, as our captain, has been evident. But he has had to deal with a range of issues, after the World Cup in Russia.’’
Meanwhile, Rohr has confirmed that Samuel Kalu remains in contention to feature for the national team at the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations, amid speculation in the media that the winger has been ruled out of action for the rest of the season.
