I picked my players from your performance, your skills and ability to play is my number 1 to number 3 requirement. I have spent my own money to develop talents; I have spent my own money to take care of players. I have never asked any penny from any player or any one. I don’t know this player to start with. I don’t know him. I can’t remember him coming to my camp. I must get to the end and bottom of this matter,” Siasia told thebreakingtimes.com.
