A former Miss Uruguay pageant winner was found dead in a Mexico Cityhotel early Thursday, authorities said. City prosecutors said a Uruguayan woman was found hanged in the bathroom of a guest room. City officials confirmed the victim had been identified as Fatimih Davila Sosa, who won the Uruguay pageant in 2006. Since then, she had apparently worked as a model. Officials said she had arrived in Mexico City on April 23 for a supposed job interview. There was no official ruling on the death. The prosecutor’s office said a homicide investigation was looking into the circumstances surrounding the hanging and whether the woman killed herself or was slain by someone.
