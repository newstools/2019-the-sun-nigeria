A new edition of African Voices, the Globacom-sponsored 30-minute magazine programme on the Cable News Network (CNN), profiles the artistic dexterities of British actor of Nigerian descent, Hakeem Kae-Kazim, and two other  film professionals. The trio, who have film-making  careers that have demonstrated how Africa can influence the global film industry will be featured on the programme which runs from Friday will also feature Osborne Macharia, a photographer, and Likarion Wainaina, a film-maker, both of whom are based in Nairobi, Kenya. The first of the guest artistes, Kae-Kazim, hails originally from Lagos, Nigeria, where he was born 57 years ago. His family later relocated to England. He gained global reckoning   with his outstanding performance in  Hotel Rwanda, a 2004 film which aped the Rwandan crisis. Kae-Kazim joined Hollywood  on the strength of his success in  Hotel Rwanda and acted in several films including Slipstream, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s end, and Black Sails. He later returned  to his fatherland to train a rising group of filmmakers for the global scene, won awards including Africa Movie Academy Award for Best Actor in 2012. He was also a nominee for the Gemini Award for Best Performance in 2004. The second is Macharia, a 33-year old commercial photographer, whose  success stemmed from a failure he recorded in 2010 while studying for a degree in Architecture.
