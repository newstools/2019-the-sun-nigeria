British number one Johanna Konta went out of the Madrid Open in the second round, losing to Romanian world number three Simona Halep. Two-time Madrid champion Halep, 27, wrapped up a 7-5 6-1 win in one hour and 30 minutes. On Sunday, world number 47 Konta, 27, lost the Morocco Open title to Maria Sakkari in her first final on clay. Halep, who won the Madrid title in 2016 and 2017, will play Slovakia’s Viktoria Kuzmova in the third round. “I feel like I started playing at a really good level,” Konta told BBC Sport. “I thought I found my footing reasonably quickly. As you would expect playing against someone like Simona, she’s going to rally back and what she does incredibly well is compete and really work her way into the points. “I definitely created chances in that first set – unfortunately I couldn’t capitalise. And then I think I just ran out of a little bit of steam there in the second set.”
