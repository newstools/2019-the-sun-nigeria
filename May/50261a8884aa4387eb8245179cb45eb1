Gyang Bere, Jos After shutting down JayFM radio station, a leading private FM in Jos for over two months under alleged curious, questionable and politically-motivated circumstance, the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) and the management of the radio station have on Wednesday opted for out-of-court settlement with a view to reopening the station without further delay. Jodaj Global Communication, owners of JayFM had, through its counsel, Mrs. H.O. Olowokere, sued the NBC before Justice Musa Kurya of the Federal High Court II sitting in Jos, demanding the immediate reopening of the station. The management of the radio station had described the closure of the station by NBC on March 1, 2019, as “unlawful, null and void,” adding that it was an action done in bad blood and an unwarranted victimisation since there was no cause for it. The station had, therefore, asked the court for an order for immediate reopening of the station and payment of N500 million to it as general damages. When the case came up for hearing before Justice Kurya on Wednesday in Jos, Olowokere told the court that there was an ongoing discussion between the station and NBC to settle the matter out of court. She said: “My Lord, the matter today is slated for hearing, but we wish to bring to the notice of this honourable court that we the parties in this case have started discussion on how to settle the matter out of court. “It’s our belief and expectation that we shall reach an agreement on the matter as we discuss. “In the light of this, my Lord, we wish to ask for an adjournment to enable us complete our discussion and report back to the court our terms of agreement. “But in the event we could not agree, we shall continue with the hearing of the matter before your Lordship.” Dr. Ogomu Onoja, NBC Jos Zonal Director, who represented the commission, which did not send a counsel to represent it in court, confirmed the submission made by Olowokere. He said: “My Lord, what the prosecuting counsel said is the true position of things in this matter. “It’s our candid belief that we shall be able to reach an accord and report back to your Lordship at the next adjourned date.” Justice Kurya then adjourned the case to May 15 for report on terms of settlement or for continuation of hearing of the case as the case may be, but declined to order for the immediate reopening of the station before the settlement process was completed since the one week adjourned date was short. function insertAfter(e,t){t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t.nextSibling)}function getElementByXPath(e,t){if(!t)t=document;if(t.evaluate)return t.evaluate(e,document,null,9,null).singleNodeValue;while(e.charAt(0)=="/")e=e.substr(1);var n=t;var r=e.split("/");for(var i=0;i<r.length;i++){var a=r[i].split(/(\w*)\[(\d*)\]/gi).filter(function(e){return!(e==""||e.match(/\s/gi))},this);var l=a[0];var o=a[1]?a[1]-1:0;if(i<r.length-1)n=n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o];else return n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o]}}if(!Array.prototype.filter){Array.prototype.filter=function(e){var t=this.length>>>0;if(typeof e!="function"){throw new TypeError}var n=[];var r=arguments[1];for(var i=0;i<t;i++){if(i in this){var a=this[i];if(e.call(r,a,i,this)){n.push(a)}}}return n}}function injectWidgetByXpath(e){var t=getElementByXPath(e);if(t==null){t=document.getElementById("tbdefault")}innerInject(t)}function injectWidgetByMarker(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);innerInject(t.parentNode)}function innerInject(e){var t=document.createElement("span");var n=document.createElement("script");var r="if JS crashes here, the first innerHTML value should be enclosed with single quotes instead of double, go to the minified version and change it";t.innerHTML="<div id='taboola-below-article'></div><div id='taboola-below-article-second'></div>";n.innerHTML="window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-c', container:'taboola-below-article', placement:'below-article', target_type: 'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-d', container:'taboola-below-article-second', placement:'below-article-2nd', target_type: 'mix'});";insertAfter(t,e);insertAfter(n,t)}injectWidgetByMarker('tbmarker');
