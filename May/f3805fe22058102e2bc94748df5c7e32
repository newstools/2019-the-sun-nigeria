Dangote Group has for the second year running emerged as the most admired African brand, of African continent origin, by consumers ahead of the  telecommunication giant, MTN in a survey of 100 Africa best brands announced in Johannesburg at the weekend. According to the South Africa based Brand Africa in a survey carried out in collaboration with the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), the seventh edition which was released at the weekend, of 15,000 brands mentioned, Dangote ranked first brand when consumers are prompted to recall the most admired African brand. In the top 100 list, the United State sports and fitness mega brand, Nike, a non-African brand retains the overall number one brand in Africa spontaneously recalled by consumers. South African telecoms brand MTN is the number one African brand spontaneously recalled brand, while surging Ethiopian brand Anbessa Shoes, at number two, swopped positions with Nigerian conglomerate, Dangote, which is the number three most admired brand of African of origin. However, when consumers are prompted to recall the most admired African brand, Dangote retains the number one position. Just last year Dangote’s brand was named the most valuable brand among the top 50 brands in Nigeria for 2018 by Brand Nigeria.
