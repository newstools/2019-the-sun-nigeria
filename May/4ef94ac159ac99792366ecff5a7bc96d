Chelsea will face London rivals, Arsenal on Wednesday night looking to cap off what had been a solid, yet unspectacular season at Stamford Bridge. While Europa League glory would be something of a bonus for the Blues, it’s absolutely crucial to the Gunners, who need victory to secure a place in the Champions League next term. However, this will only provide the Blues with extra incentive to secure victory.
Chelsea looked set to be without N’Golo Kante for their crucial Europa League final clash with Arsenal. The France international was on track to return from a calf injury for the showpiece event in Baku, but it’s been reported that the midfielder had suffered a setback in his recovery.
