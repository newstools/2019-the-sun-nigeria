Anthony Joshua is known for his raw power but the world heavyweight champion has furthered his reputation for being hard-hitting after taking a punching bag off its hinges during training. The 29-year-old continues to ramp up his preparations ahead of his fight against Andy Ruiz Jnr as he trained in Miami with Jamie Velocity. The Nike Master trainer showed on his Instagram page the damage that can be inflicted by Joshua as a punching bag laid on the floor with its supports just barely attached to the wall. It comes weeks before Joshua is set to face Ruiz at Madison Square Garden in New York City on June 1. Joshua was meant to face Jarrell Miller but the American withdrew from the bout after failing a drugs tests. Ruiz is no slouch, though, with American-born Ruiz having won 32 of his 33 professional fights to date, with 21 coming by KO. Joshua’s promoter Eddie Hearn had to admit the California–based boxer has a rotund image problem: ‘He’s a credible contender with a good record but my one concern is that his appearance makes him a hard sell.’ Ruiz is three inches shorter than Joshua and will be out-reached by a massive eight inches but he has fast hands and his record offers better statistics. Joshua will be putting his WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO titles on line when the two meet at the beginning of next month.
