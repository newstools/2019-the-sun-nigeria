Considering all the internal political challenges facing the APC, the PGF under Bagudu’s leadership pledges to mobilise all party members and by extension Nigerians towards expanding and deepening democratic structures of the party by focusing on initiatives to guarantee the development of participatory governance structures as well as the guarantee of transparent, credible decision-making process within the APC,” the statement read.
