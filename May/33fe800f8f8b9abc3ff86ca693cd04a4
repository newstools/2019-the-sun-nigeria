The establishment of the new Rugby Club is an initiative / brain child of Mr. Larinde Williams who is a politician from the community and has decided to use the beautiful game of Rugby to impact positively on the lives of the citizenry and in particular the youths of his constituency towards giving them an alternative sporting activity which will put food on the table for their families and bring them to limelight.
