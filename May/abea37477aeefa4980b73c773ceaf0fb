The Zambian government said on Friday that Vice-President Inonge Wina has continued to recover well in South Africa with all cardiac parameters within normal range. The vice-president suffered heart attack on April 26, and was immediately attended to by a team of specialist doctors at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, the countryâ€™s capital. She was later evacuated to South Africa for more specialised treatment. Minister of Health Chitalu Chilufya said in a brief statement that the vice-president was fully mobilised, feeding well and was in high spirits. (Xinhua/NAN)
