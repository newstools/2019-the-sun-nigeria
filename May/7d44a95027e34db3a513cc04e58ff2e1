And now the watch has ended Many played the game for the throne King this Queen that One by one they fell The throne many fought over, lusted after and died for Now flows through the halls like melted wax The wheel has been broken Things are no longer the same If you thought The Game would have a fairy-tale ending You were not paying attention The Game took eight long years to play Five books and more yet to come A tale about long ago and far away Yet a story for today and beyond Years pass, humanity learns very little Ten thousand, five thousand, two thousand or even two years Time means nothing to the sun, moon and stars Mere mortals never fully grasp their place in the universe So in their folly they play God and even become god When winter comes bringing death and despair Testing the strong and devouring the weak After the fires have burned and the ashes have covered the land Lords and peasants alike count the cost and lessons learnt The wise might ask, ‘What do we know? What don’t we know?’ Let the children be told Alas, there is no divine right to rule Only a sacred call to service Our word should be our bond We can be born to riches but honour is earned Every teacher has a message Every student has a mission The bastard of today Might be the King of tomorrow The ugly dwarf we have been taught to despise Might be the one blessed with the most wisdom in the land The breaker of chains and the saviour of children Is also the merciless tyrant who burns the helpless and defenceless to a crisp The orphaned girls who were tortured, raped and beaten Rose to reign as Queens The least of us might one day become the greatest of us The heavens have a way of healing broken bodies, minds and spirits The strong can only prey on the weak for a season One day the forgotten and invisible will find a voice and a reason Terror, tyranny, plague, oppression Love, betrayal, loyalty, passion all rule the hearts of men and women From one eternity to the next, the wheel keeps spinning If you play the game of thrones, you either win or you die Those who played lost and those who were not in the game at all won The wheel has been broken, it is a new world now We all yearn for when men and women will rule the land on merit With courage, devotion and sacrifice Then the age of entitlement will be over – we pray If all lessons have fallen on deaf ears, please remember this Valar Morghulis All men must die Valar Dohaeris All men must serve • Bisi Adeleye-Fayemi is a gender specialist, social entrepreneur and writer.
