 Femi Folaranmi,Â Yenagoa A group, Association of Bayelsa Professionals (ABP) has faulted the decision of the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) to arraign the Speaker of Bayelsa State House of Assembly, Kombowei Benson, describing it as political intimidation. The General Secretary of ABP, Dr. Jasper Timiebi, in a statement called on the tribunal to resist the political pressure of being used as a tool to witch-hunt perceived enemies by some elements in the corridors of power. Timiebi appealed to the leadership of the CCT to protect its image and resist pressure from politicians to use the tribunal to fight their personal battles. He alleged that the investigations had indicated that the lawmaker, representing the Brass 1 Constituency in the Bayelsa State House of Assembly, Mr. Sunny Goli, who is a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), was behind the recent plan to arraign the speaker and the others for alleged abuse of office. Timiebi said that while the group would not delve into political disputes, the ABP was opposed to acts that were deliberately designed to undermine the peace and stability of the state. He called on the CCT leadership to investigate allegations made against the Speaker and the three others in order to arrive at the truth which should guide the decisions of the tribunal. The ABP scribe urged the leadership of the CCT to halt the impending arraignment of the speaker and others to avoid sending out wrong signals that members of the opposition PDP were being persecuted because of a lawmaker from the APC. He said that the CCT is a federal agency which should be of service to Nigerians irrespective of political affiliations.
