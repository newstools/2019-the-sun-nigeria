The Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, has warned that any student caught in the act of indecent dressing would incur the wrath of the school. The Dean of Student Affairs, Prof. Babatunde Idowu, made this known in a statement made available to journalists on Thursday in Abeokuta. The school management, in the statement, decried the rise in acts of indecent dressing and unkempt appearances among students of the university. It reiterated its directive that any student caught dressing contrary to the university’s Code of Dressing should be dealt with in accordance with the extant University Rules and Regulations.
