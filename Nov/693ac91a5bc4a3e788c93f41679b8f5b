Federal University of Technology Akure (FUTA) has expelled six students for allegedly assaulting another student. The expulsion was communicated by the Deputy Director of Corporate Communications of the institution, Adegbenro Adebanjo, yesterday. Adegbenro said the expulsion followed the recommendation of an investigative panel which probed the incident that took place in an off-campus hostel on November 16. “The expelled students are Popoola Olaniyi Agboola IDD/ (300L), Oluwadare Faith Tobiloba FST ( 200L), Nandi Yohanna Jessica IPE/ (200L), Ajuwon Tolani Emmanuella FAT/ (100L), Emmanuel Funmilayo Taiwo FAT/ (100L) and Alao Olabimpe Cecilia CSP/ (100 L). “The expulsion is in line with the position of Page 48 of the 2019/2020 Students Handbook which prescribes expulsion from the university for students who engage in physical assault or battery on another student outside the university premises. “As a consequence of their expulsion, their studentship of FUTA ceases forthwith with all its rights and privileges,” he said. Last week, video clips of where a group of five students — one male, four females — were seen beating up a female 100 level student in her room rippled on social media.
