Anthony Joshua has been mercilessly mocked by rival Deontay Wilder, who steadfastly refuted any comparisons to the British heavyweight. Wilder, who defends his WBC heavyweight title against Luis Ortiz on November 23, poked fun at what he believes to be Joshua’s weak mindset. AJ famously lost his WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO championships to Andy Ruiz Jr by TKO in June and is preparing for a rematch in Saudia Arabia on December 7. Before the loss to Ruiz, Wilder and Joshua seemed on a collision course to unify the heavyweight division but the two have since splintered off into rivalries with Tyson Fury and Ruiz respectively. However, should the two win their upcoming bouts and Wilder defeat Fury when they are expected to rematch in February, then the fight could still occur. Speaking ahead of the Ortiz clash, Wilder said: “Me and Anthony Joshua have a different mindset. “My mindset is very strong. It’s way stronger than him, and I spoke about this before. Joshua, he called upon it himself. “He knew he was going to lose one day. He even spoke it to the universe. “Even when it came time to happen, he gave his belts over to Ruiz. He literally transported his belts to this man. His energy gave the belts to the man. You could see it. “For me, my mindset is different. I’m a totally different kind of person, and a totally different beast. And I’m the best in the world, and I prove it each and every time I go inside the ring. “I’m not worried about going in there and making mistakes and stuff. And if I do make any mistakes in the ring, rest assured, I will correct it as the fight goes on. “I’m fighting for one champion, one face, one name – the undisputed champion. Nobody will get in my way, nobody.”
