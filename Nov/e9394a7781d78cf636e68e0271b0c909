As the Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), Oscar N. Onyema is a member of Nigeria’s elite group. Give it to the boss of Nigeria’s main bourse; he’s like a real catch, the kind of guy his peers lose a girl to —a blue blood with good family name, money and the handsome grin. The dark dude, who is the last born of His Royal Majesty, Eze V.B.C Onyema III, the Eze of Ogwu-Ikpele Ogbaru, Anambra State, has too many ladies seeking his attention. It was reliably gathered that he never denies them anything from the abundance of his material and physical endowments. However, to the consternation of many, Oscar seems not to have found his missing ribs from any of those female admirers that have crossed his path. This, it was gathered, has got his family members and close friends worried sick over his refusal to get married at over 50. While different reasons have been adduced for his decision to stay single, one poignant tale attributed to his bachelor status was his fear of commitment and the hassles involved in getting married and staying married. Whatever, Oscar remains a good guy in his circle of friends and among his professional associates. Prior to his resumption as the head honcho of the Nigerian Stock Exchange in April 2011, Oscar has made his mark on Wall Street and the American Stock Exchange (AMEX). He was the first person of colour to hold the senior vice president position at AMEX and the bouquet of experience he garnered from the American financial services industry has really helped him in delivering his mandate at the Nigerian exchange.
