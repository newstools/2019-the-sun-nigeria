According to Abubakar , “for more than two weeks , there was no night that three persons were not kidnapped and whenever we report to the police, they seem helpless. Going to the House of Assembly was in good faith, because we believe the lawmakers can make case for the police to have needed support from the government.
“Unfortunately, as we were leaving the House of Assembly, more than 20 police vehicles loaded with armed policemen, arrived and started displaying the highest level of unprofessional conducts.
“The policemen were abusing uu and disparaging us. They called us all sorts of names that violated and stripped us of human dignity. They started harassing and intimidating us . They arrested some of us and I was one of those that were arrested.
