The Police Service Commission (PSC), says it will deploy 45 of its personnel to monitor police conduct in the Nov. 16, Governorship and House of Assembly elections in Kogi and Bayelsa. Mr Ikechukwu Ani, Head, Press and Public Relations of the commission, disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday, in Abuja. Ani said 20 of the personnel would be deployed to Bayelsa and 25 to Kogi to ensure officers complied with the force’s rules of engagement. He said cases of police misconduct that would arise from the exercise would be investigated; and any police officer found guilty would be punished accordingly. He urged officers to ensure that they operated within the law and be professional in their conduct while remaining neutral and apolitical. The spokesman said the monitors would be deployed to all the local government areas of the two states. According to him, the teams would arrive in the respective states on Wednesday, to monitor the deployment of men, materials and conduct of police officers before, during and after the elections.
