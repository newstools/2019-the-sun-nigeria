A 13-year-old survivor of the attack by suspected Mexican drug cartel gunmen on a convoy of US Mormons hid six siblings in bushes before walking 23km (14 miles) to get help, his family has said. Eight children survived Monday’s attack in northern Mexico in which three women and six children were killed. Five of the children have bullet wounds, US media report. The victims are members of the LeBaron family, linked to a Mormon community that settled in Mexico decades ago. Mexico’s security minister said the group could have been targeted accidentally as a result of mistaken identity. However family members have said the community, known for speaking out about cartel violence, had received threats in the past.
