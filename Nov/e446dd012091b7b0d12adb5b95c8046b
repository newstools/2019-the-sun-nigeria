Laide Raheem, Abeokuta A senator, representing Lagos West, Olamilekan Adeola, has expressed his readiness to upgrade the pavilion at the Empire Field Event Arena in Ilaro, to a 3,000-seater, to accommodate more guests who throng the town for the annual Oronna/Ilaro festival. Adeola, also known as Yayi, stated this at the weekend during the grand finale of the festival in Ilaro, Yewa South Local Government Area of Ogun State. The senator, who was the chairman on the occasion, said the pavilion, which was constructed in 2012, needed to be rebuilt to seat at least 3,000 guests in a comfortable manner comparable to what is in place in Ijebu Ode and Abeokuta for similar socio-cultural activities.
