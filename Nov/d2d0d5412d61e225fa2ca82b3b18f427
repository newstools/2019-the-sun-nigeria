Former President, Olusegun Obasanjo, has thrown his full weight behind the Pan-African #endxenophobia charity concert aimed at promoting African unity and oneness. Organised by The Bridge Concepts, on the platform of One United Africa, the event is scheduled to hold early next year. “It is conceived as a necessary supplement to ongoing diplomatic efforts to address the black-on-black recriminations, which became dominant in recent months and the potential threat it harbours for the continent, if allowed to fester,” Dele Omoyeni, Manager, Public Communications, The Bridge Concept, says. In a letter personally signed by Obasanjo and addressed to the organiser of the concert, Bimbo Daramola, Obasanjo stated: “Xenophobia or Afrophobia, which is ongoing in South Africa, is a most unfortunate issue not only for South Africa, but indeed for the whole of Africa.” This situation, Obasanjo noted, calls for “concerted efforts and partnership from all well-meaning individuals within and without Africa, to curb it so that great, positive impact can be made in the lives of African people across the continent.” The concert is billed to attract an array of frontline African artistes, who will also develop an ‘end xenophobia’ theme song in what the organisers describe as a new paradigm, aimed at taking the crusade to the real people on the streets of Africa, reminiscent of the USA For Africa’s We Are The World, conceived to drum up global support for Africa’s poor and underprivileged.
