 George Onyjiuwa, Owerri A summit to explore and review the cultural relationship between the Igbo and the Jews will hold soon. The summit which has as its theme: “Harnessing the Economic Gains of Socio- Cultural Affinity between the Igbos and Hebrews,” is expected  to hold between   November 11 and 13, in Owerri, the Imo State capital. Briefing newsmen on Sunday ahead of the summit, the National President, Igbo Hebrew Cultural Heritage Organization, Mr. Jerry Egemba, said that the  issue concerning Igbo-Hebrew relationship has been a long standing one on which various researches had been done without bringing it to a logical conclusion. According to him, the summit would feature agricultural experts like Dr. Carey Edward Chris Imas, former Israeli Minister of Agriculture and organic agriculture expert, that would talk on advanced and technological means of farming so that the summit participants could acquire the knowledge and implement it in producing enough food. “In the area of farming, we are not producing much because we don’t even know how to improve either on the seedlings or even improvement in the land we plant. Most of us are ignorant, so when you come, you will learn, you will go back, apply it and better your life and the life of people and be able to be engaged in producing foods for many more people who are hungry to eat. “So, we would like to make it a public thing and a national matter so that in agriculture, you don’t have to be from this part of Nigeria for you to benefit from this wealth of knowledge”, Egemba stated. He added that “it’s going to be a dialogue of a sort that would involve as many as are interested in the subject and who will really want the public to get to know why they hold the views they hold and so strongly so too. “We have international guests coming from Israel and we have some others also coming from South Africa. We are expecting our U.S.A friends to come.  function insertAfter(e,t){t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t.nextSibling)}function getElementByXPath(e,t){if(!t)t=document;if(t.evaluate)return t.evaluate(e,document,null,9,null).singleNodeValue;while(e.charAt(0)=="/")e=e.substr(1);var n=t;var r=e.split("/");for(var i=0;i<r.length;i++){var a=r[i].split(/(\w*)\[(\d*)\]/gi).filter(function(e){return!(e==""||e.match(/\s/gi))},this);var l=a[0];var o=a[1]?a[1]-1:0;if(i<r.length-1)n=n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o];else return n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o]}}if(!Array.prototype.filter){Array.prototype.filter=function(e){var t=this.length>>>0;if(typeof e!="function"){throw new TypeError}var n=[];var r=arguments[1];for(var i=0;i<t;i++){if(i in this){var a=this[i];if(e.call(r,a,i,this)){n.push(a)}}}return n}}function injectWidgetByXpath(e){var t=getElementByXPath(e);if(t==null){t=document.getElementById("tbdefault")}innerInject(t)}function injectWidgetByMarker(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);innerInject(t.parentNode)}function innerInject(e){var t=document.createElement("span");var n=document.createElement("script");var r="if JS crashes here, the first innerHTML value should be enclosed with single quotes instead of double, go to the minified version and change it";t.innerHTML="<div id='taboola-below-article'></div><div id='taboola-below-article-second'></div>";n.innerHTML="window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-c', container:'taboola-below-article', placement:'below-article', target_type: 'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-d', container:'taboola-below-article-second', placement:'below-article-2nd', target_type: 'mix'});";insertAfter(t,e);insertAfter(n,t)}injectWidgetByMarker('tbmarker');
