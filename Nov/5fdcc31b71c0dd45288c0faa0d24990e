Ighomuaye Lucky, Benin Eight students of Samuel Adegboyega University have bagged first class honour degrees during the 2019 convocation ceremony of the institution scheduled for the weekend. The Vice Chancellor of the institution, Prof Ben Aigbokhan, stated this yesterday while briefing reporters on the successes recorded so far since the inception of the institution in Ogwa, Esan West Local Government Area of Edo State. He announced that 79 students will be graduating from the institution and eight among them will be graduating with first class honours, 30 with second class upper, 35 second class lower, six with third class while non graduated with pass. Prof. Aigbokhan said the institution over the years has also had zero tolerance for cultism and other social vices, stressing that in order to ensure that students are well behaved, sanctions such as suspension for two semesters are usually meted out to students caught smoking cigarettes,Â  and that in more severe cases such students are expelled from the institution to serve as deterrent to others. He decried the inability of private institutions to access TETFund to carry out researches despite their numerous contributions to development of the Nigerian economy. According to the Vice Chancellor, the outcome of the research findings will be of immense benefit to the country, as he appealed for the removal of the bottlenecks militating against private universities accessing the TETFund.
