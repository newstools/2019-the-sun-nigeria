According to him, the company is certain to sustain the performance all through the year, promising that shareholders will have increased value from their investment at the close of business in 2019. The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of CHI, Mr. Eddie Efekoha, said that the unwavering support of the board and management of the company was pivotal to the success recorded. He said, “The strong performance reflects the board and management’s commitment towards rewarding our shareholders with good returns. There is no gainsaying that consistent improvement is also being driven by the increased confidence of our customers.” On plans to increase the minimum paid-up capital of the company to N10 billion in line with the new requirements of the National Insurance Commission, Efekoha said arrangements have been finalised to get the approval of shareholders for the raising of additional N4.5 billion during an Extra-Ordinary General Meeting (EGM). He expressed confidence that the company will successfully beef up its capital base further, ahead of the June 2020 deadline by NAICOM, in view of positive investor confidence displayed during the earlier proactive efforts by the board to raise N500 million through a rights issue and an additional N734 million through a private placement, both of which were fully subscribed even before the recent recapitalisation mandate by NAICOM. For its part, Mr Ben Ujoatuonu, the Managing Director of Universal Insurance Plc, noted that the reduction in claims payout was achieved due to the company’s ability to assess risks accepted effectively and efficiently. He added that the company holds dear claims settlement obligations and with delight attends to issues of genuine claims with dispatch. “It is noteworthy to mention that Universal Insurance is one of the 44 underwriting firms given the ‘No Objection’ status by the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) to carry out its recapitalisation plans”, Ujoatuonu said.
