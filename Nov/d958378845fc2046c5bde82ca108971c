Christopher Oji Idoma socio-cultural group, Ochetoha K’ Idoma,  has decried alleged marginalisation of  Idoma in Benue State. The group, which stated this during  the 46th delegates conference in Otukpo  canvassed government‘s intervention. In a communique, the group  called for rotation of power, particularly governorship of the state among the three senatorial zones. The communiqué read: “Lopsided political leadership and public service appointment in the state should be addressed. Unavailability of infrastructure, economic and social amenities in Idoma land and the distortion of socio-cultural heritage of idoma culture and tradition should be addressed; boundary encroachment by the Tivs from Gwer West  is unacceptable.” The group also praised president Mohammadu Buhari for the establishment of Federal University of Health Sciences in Otukpo.
