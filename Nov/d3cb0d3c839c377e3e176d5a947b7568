The Governing Board of National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), has appealed to Kano State Government to reconstruct access road to the state orientation camp which is in bad shape.
Hajiya Binta Mu’azu, a member of the board made the call while on inspection visit to the orientation camp in Karaye Local Government Area (LGA) of the state.
According to her, the call is necessary looking at the current condition of the five kilometre access road to the camp.
“We are appealing to Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje to look into the issue with a view to reducing the hardship being faced by corps members posted to the state while trying to reach the camp.
“If not for the facilities already in the camp, I will have requested the state government to move it nearer to town, due to the distance and bad condition of the road.
“I assure you, we are going to do everything possible to meet with the governor and table all our issues, because we have some challenges that needed government’s attention,” she said.
She also commended the state government for its numerous support to NYSC, hoping that such good relationship would go beyond the present level.
According to her, the visit is to see the condition of the orientation camp and the state of facilities to ensure the well being of corps members and camp officials.
The state NYSC Coordinator, Alhaji Ladan Baba thanked the board for the visit.(NAN)
