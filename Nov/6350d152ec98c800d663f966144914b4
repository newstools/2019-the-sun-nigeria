Okwe Obi, Abuja Displeased with the high rate of open defecation in the country, Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu, has said that President Muhammadu Buhari would soon sign an executive order to address the problem. Presently, Nigeria is number one in global ranking as over 47 million citizens indulge in open defecation. Adamu, who disclosed this yesterday in Abuja at a press briefing to launch a campaign against open defecation tagged: ‘Clean Nigeria: Use the toilet campaign’, noted that the government would do everything to ensure that Nigerians desist from the unwholesome practice. “In the wash action plan that we are promoting which the states are adopting, there is a provision for some legislation to be made against open defecation, and there is going to be an executive order signed by President Buhari to that effect, where there is going to be a law against open defecation, the law enforcement agencies will do their bit. “We are not trying to coerce people, but open defecation is a bad practice and should be stopped,” he said. According to Adamu, the campaign would showcase the negativity of indiscriminate defecation, and disabuse the minds of people indulging in the insidious act. “We are hoping that once the campaign gets into the minds of people, our job is done. So, when the communities begin to see that this is not right , their behaviour will change. And at the end of the day, what is left for us is monitoring the process and if the communities are not doing it we will apply some tested methods to go and trigger them and find a way to mobilise them and do more advocacy for them,” he added. He, however, appealed to government at all levels to provide basic facilities, “because if there is no alternative, the call of nature can meet anyone anywhere. If we all unite in this we will get there by 2025.”
