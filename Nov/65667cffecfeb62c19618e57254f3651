I, therefore, call for a buy-in partners in order to extend our programmes to rural communities across the country,” he said. “The training is aimed at transforming them from being ordinary farmers to agriculturists with modern technological productivity and then to become employers of labour in agricultural sector.” He disclosed that a total of 1,800 youths across the country have been recruited and would be trained in useful skills to improve their knowledge in sustanaibake agricultural ventures.
