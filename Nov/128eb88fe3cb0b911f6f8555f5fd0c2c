Ighomuaye Lucky, Benin An inmate of Oko Medium Correctional Centre, in Benin, Edo State, Victor Ogunsuyi, who had spent more than 13 years awaiting trial, was yesterday set free by the State Chief Judge, Justice Esohe Ikponmwen. Ikponmwen  gave the order for Ogunsuyi’s  release during the on-going Correctional Service decongestion visit. He also ordered the release of Joel Ogbeide, who had spent over six years in custody awaiting trial.  They were among four inmates set free by the outgoing Chief Judge at the Oko Centre. Others included  Moses Okoro, whose case file was missing and had been in custody for over seven years. Okoro was locked behind bars over his alleged involvement in the death of Olaitan Oyerinde, the then Principal Private Secretary to former Governor Adams Oshiomhole. Following the inability of the State Public Prosecution (DPP), and the Police to explain the mutilated figures and why he had multiple warrants, Ikpomwen, ordered his release, noting that, “there is no justifiable cause to hold him in custody.” On his part, Joseph Effiong, was released, following a review of a letter written by the DPP about a year ago, “that there is no prima facie case established against him”. A total of 1,032 cases would be reviewed during the visit to various Correctional facilities across the State by the outgoing Chief Judge. Earlier, the Deputy Controller of Corrections in charge of the medium custodial centre, Mr. Godwin Evboeruan, explained the  reasons for the change of name of the Service, “as inmates will now see the centre as a correctional one and not only set up to punish them”.
