Our product speaks for itself anywhere you find it. Let me not forget to tell you that we empower people as well. If you would like to join the Green Leaf family, we have a relationship with our bank where the bank can grant loans to people to begin sales with us. “As we all know that Nigeria has the largest market in Africa, and with the kind of acceptance we got in the last 12 months, we are very ready to make it bigger than it was in the last 12 months,” she said.
