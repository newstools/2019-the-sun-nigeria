Tony Osauzo, Benin Edo Police command this evening, foiled an attempt by armed robbers to attack the Benin branch of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The robbers were said to have attempted to break into the bank when a bullion van carrying cash to an unknown commercial bank was about leaving the CBN premises but were however repelled by the armed police security team at the bank. The exchange of gunfire between the bank security and the robbers forced people and motorists on the busy Akpakpa Road to scamper for safety. The exchange of firepower which lasted for few minutes forced the robbers to retreat and escape but no casualty was recorded in the shoot-out. At the time of filing this report, more policemen had been drafted from the state police command to beef up security at the CBN. Neither the state Commissioner of Police, Danmallam Mohammed, nor the spokesman of the state police command, Mr. Chidi Nwabuzor, could be reached. The commissionerâ€™s mobile line was switched off while Nwabuzor was said to be away from Benin on official duty.
