Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa All Progressives Congress (APC) has said it has directed its lawyers to appeal the Abuja Federal High Court ruling on the candidacy of the deputy-governor in the forthcoming Bayelsa November 16 election, Senator Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo. The APC said the judgement delivered on Tuesday cannot stand the scrutiny of a superior court. According to the publicity secretary of Bayelsa APC, Doifie Buokoribo, the court did not consider the weight of evidence before it in delivering the judgement. The statement read in part: “The judgement occasioned a miscarriage of justice, is glaringly perverse and against the weight of evidence before the court. We are totally surprised that the court could despite the objections by our lawyers, go ahead to determine a weighty criminal allegation of falsification and fraud solely on the bases of affidavit evidence contrary to well established judicial precedents that such must be proved beyond reasonable doubt by calling oral evidence. “We strongly believe that the judgment cannot withstand superior judicial scrutiny; therefore, our lawyers have filed a notice of appeal and other court processes to arrest the execution of the judgment pending the outcome of the appeal. “We call on all our members and supporters not to be distracted, but continue to peacefully mobilise for the  November 16, 2019, election.”
