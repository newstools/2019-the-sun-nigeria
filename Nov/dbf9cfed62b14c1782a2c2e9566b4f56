Lukman Olabiyi, Lagos A 32-year-old football coach identified as Leodina Ahamadah was remanded in prison custody on Wednesday by the Lagos State Magistrate Court, Igbosere, for the alleged anal rape of a 9-year-old boy. Magistrate Mrs K O Doja-Ojo remanded the defendant in prison pending legal advice from the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP). Ahamadah, who resides at Idi-Aba area of Lekki Beach road, was docked on a one-count charge of forceful rape, preferred against him by the police. The prosecutor, Inspector Peace Chukwudi, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on November 18. She said that the incident took place at Idi-Aba area of Lekki Beach road, at about 8 am. Chukwudi said: “The defendant forcefully and sexually penetrated the victim’s anus with his penis, without his consent.” “Ahamadah, who charges N150 to N200 to coach the boy and other children, had approached the boy to come and play football on the day of the incident and the boy had told him that he wasn’t going as he had no money. “The defendant however told him not to worry that he would pay for him to practice and play football for that day. “Instead of taking him to where they play football, the coach took him to his house and raped him through the anus,” she said. According to her, the offence committed is punishable under Section 261 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015. However, the plea of the defendant was not taken by the court. Magistrate Doja-Ojo asked the defendant to approach the High Court to seek for bail, as the court does not have the jurisdiction to grant bail. She ordered that the case file be duplicated and sent to the Director of Public Production DPP for legal advice. The case was adjourned till December 12 for DPP’s advice.
