Speaking on her feat, Careen, who came second at the maiden JAC Motors Abeokuta 10km Race in Abeokuta, Ogun State, expressed delight in victory. “I am happy with the race and the organisation. It was not easy winning because the weather was very hot. But I thank God I won it. I ran in the 10km in Abeokuta race and I came over to Lagos to participate in this one. “I finished second in Abeokuta because there were many Kenyans and Ethiopians. But here I was the only the Kenyan. I had to train hard, especially with the men twice a day. But I think today’s race is less than 10 kilometres,” she said.
