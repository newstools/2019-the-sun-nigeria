The Court of Appeal sitting in Makurdi, on Tuesday, upheld the decision of the election petition tribunal affirming the election of Engineer Abdullahi Sule as Governor of Nasarawa State. The superior court, presided by Justice Jumai Sankey, in its judgement, resolved all the five issues raised in the petition brought before it against the appellants, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its 2019 governorship candidate, Hon. David Ombugadu. The court held that the appellants were unable to prove their case and thereby affirmed the verdict earlier passed by the tribunal, which confirmed that Engineer Sule was legally and lawfully returned as Governor of Nasarawa State. Speaking on the judgement, counsel to the Nasarawa State Governor, Dr. Mubarak Adekunle, hailed the decision of the Appeal Court. “The Court of Appeal in Makurdi has just delivered its judgement. The court resolved all the five issues against the appellant. “The tribunal stroke out several paragraphs of their reply to Engineer A. A Sule’s reply. They appealed against that. The Court of Appeal affirmed it that the tribunal was very right, to have stroke out all those paragraphs. “On all the allegations which borders on disenfranchisement, cancellation of votes, inflation of votes and deflation of votes, the Court of Appeal affirmed that the tribunal was right, that they were unable to prove their allegations. “Finally, on whether Engineer A. A Sule was fully or properly returned as elected, the Court of Appeal also affirmed that having resolved all the allegations against the appellant, that they were unable to prove their case, affirmed the verdict of the tribunal, that Engineer Sule was legally, lawfully and properly returned as Governor of Nasarawa State,” Adekunle stated.
