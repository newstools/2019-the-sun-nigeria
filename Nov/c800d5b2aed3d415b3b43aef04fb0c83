Thus, it is needless to say that an effective implementation of the SDGs requires sustained production of statistical information by all the relevant stakeholders” she said. The presidential aide however, observed that production of statistics has some challenges, a  reason government is putting in place  enabling environment to guarantee continuous production of  statistics for tracking and monitoring the implementation of the SDGs in Nigeria.
