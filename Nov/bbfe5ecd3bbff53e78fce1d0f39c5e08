The police in Lokoja yesterday confirmed three persons dead during the governorship election held in Kogi on Saturday. The Commissioner of Police in Kogi, Mr Akeem Busari, who confirmed the deaths to newsmen, said that the command was still compiling its report on the poll to ascertain the actual number of casualties. Busari also said 10 persons were arrested across the state during the election. He said it was gathered that three persons died in Lokoja when armed thugs invaded St. Luke Primary School, Adanakolo, during the election. Busari, however, described the situation in the state as calm. Meanwhile, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has announced the poll results from eight more local government areas. The results showed that Gov. Yahaya Bello, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), polled 36,954 votes in Okehi Local Government Area while Mr Musa Wada of the PDP scored 478 votes.
