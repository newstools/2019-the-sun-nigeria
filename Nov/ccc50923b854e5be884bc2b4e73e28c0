A Swedish appeals court has found former Nigeria international, Dickson Etuhu guilty for attempted match-fixing. The Court of Appeals in Stockholm said in a release yesterday said that it was clear that Etuhu and an unnamed former player tried to influence AIK keeper Kyriakos “Kenny” Stamatopoulos to fix a match in Sweden’s top division in 2017. Etuhu, who played for several English clubs including Manchester City, Sunderland and Fulham, escaped a jail sentence but was instead fined and sentenced to serve probation, without further details being made public. The 37-year-old, who left AIK Solna in 2016, said he will be appealing against the ruling at the Supreme Court. The court said that “the content of what the men submitted to the player (Stamatopoulos) was so clear that it should be considered a criminal offer of bribe.” A court had intially acquitted Etuhu last year but prosecutor Johan Lindmark, who told local Swedish newspaper Expressen that he was satisfied with yesterday’s outcome. that. “It was with satisfaction that I received the verdict today,” Lindmark said. “I had appealed on the grounds that I thought the court of law would change and was not surprised when I saw the verdict.” Etuhu played 20 times for the Super Eagles including at twice at the Africa Cup of Nations in 2008 and 2010 as well the World Cup in South Africa. An appeals court has found former Premier League player Dickson Etuhu guilty of attempting to fix a match in Sweden’s top division, overturning the verdict of a lower court.
