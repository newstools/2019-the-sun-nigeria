A trader who do not want his name mentioned told our correspondent that the traders in the market were wary of the invasion of their stalls , because according to the source, some victims from other markets in the state had reliably informed them. “When we had they were coming, everybody started running helter skelter, we ran in different directions, we don’t know where they were coming from, some us were wounded as a result of the fear of the custom carrying our goods away.
