The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), has appealed to Nigerian youths, particularly students, to distance themselves from criminal tendencies capable of disrupting their future endeavours. Mr. Isyaku Sharu, Head of the EFCC Zonal Office in Ilorin made the appeal on Tuesday while addressing students at the University of Ilorin. Sharu said the call had become necessary following the increasing pervasiveness of cyber crimes, otherwise called “Yahoo-Yahoo”, among the youth. He said that many of the suspects currently being investigated for one form of financial crime or the other were students of several institutions of higher learning across Nigeria. Sharu said that the commission, would in strict adherence to the laws of the land, stop at nothing in the eradication of the scourge. He said that he was particularly disturbed by the high number of students who were involved in swindling of innocent individuals and organisations of their hard-earned resources. Sharu charged students to face their studies squarely and never be enchanted with the get-rich-quick syndrome, which according to him, often propelled the misguided ones into criminalities. He explained that the sky could not limit the success of those who were hardworking, honest and law-abiding. The EFCC Zonal Head explained that the laws guiding the activities of his Commission have no respect for the age of suspects. He reiterated the commitment of the EFCC to continue to do everything within its capacity to bring the incidence of criminality down. Sharu added that the commission was ready to address any information brought to its attention without any special treatment for age or any other stratification into which the suspect may fall. He, therefore, implored students to attach greater importance to moral values and respect for constituted authorities at all times to avoid the wrath of the law. (NAN)
