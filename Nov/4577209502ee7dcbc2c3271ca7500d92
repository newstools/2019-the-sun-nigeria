John Adams, Minna  Men of the Niger State Fire Service this afternoon prevented a fire outbreak at the office of the Permanent Secretary, Niger State Government House, Minna. The fire outbreak, which started at about 12:35 pm was put out by a combined team of fire fighters at about 1:03 pm. Chief Press Secretary to the Governor of Niger State, Mrs Mary Noel-Berje, who made this known in a statement on Wednesday, hailed men of the state fire service who mobilised three fire-fighting vans to the scene within 15 minutes of the fire outbreak. The permanent secretaryâ€™s office, which was under renovation had electrical fault. The fire affected office furniture and other office valuables. Speaking during the incident, the Deputy Controller, State Fire Service, Salihu Bello, said even though there were no fire-fighting engines in the Government House as at the time of the incident, the state Fire Service was able to mobilise three engines to the scene under 15 minutes and stopped the fire. He explained that lack of fire-fighting trucks in Government House was not intentional as those in the area were taken out for routine maintenance. function insertAfter(e,t){t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t.nextSibling)}function getElementByXPath(e,t){if(!t)t=document;if(t.evaluate)return t.evaluate(e,document,null,9,null).singleNodeValue;while(e.charAt(0)=="/")e=e.substr(1);var n=t;var r=e.split("/");for(var i=0;i<r.length;i++){var a=r[i].split(/(\w*)\[(\d*)\]/gi).filter(function(e){return!(e==""||e.match(/\s/gi))},this);var l=a[0];var o=a[1]?a[1]-1:0;if(i<r.length-1)n=n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o];else return n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o]}}if(!Array.prototype.filter){Array.prototype.filter=function(e){var t=this.length>>>0;if(typeof e!="function"){throw new TypeError}var n=[];var r=arguments[1];for(var i=0;i<t;i++){if(i in this){var a=this[i];if(e.call(r,a,i,this)){n.push(a)}}}return n}}function injectWidgetByXpath(e){var t=getElementByXPath(e);if(t==null){t=document.getElementById("tbdefault")}innerInject(t)}function injectWidgetByMarker(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);innerInject(t.parentNode)}function innerInject(e){var t=document.createElement("span");var n=document.createElement("script");var r="if JS crashes here, the first innerHTML value should be enclosed with single quotes instead of double, go to the minified version and change it";t.innerHTML="<div id='taboola-below-article'></div><div id='taboola-below-article-second'></div>";n.innerHTML="window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-c', container:'taboola-below-article', placement:'below-article', target_type: 'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-d', container:'taboola-below-article-second', placement:'below-article-2nd', target_type: 'mix'});";insertAfter(t,e);insertAfter(n,t)}injectWidgetByMarker('tbmarker');
