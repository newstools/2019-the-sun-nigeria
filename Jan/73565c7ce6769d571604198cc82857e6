Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja The Presidency has described a call by opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for disobedience against the state as anarchy. The executive arm of government pushed back by calling on Nigerians not to allow the PDP sabotage the country’s democracy. Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity Garba Shehu, responding to statements by the party, said: “We read the various statements issued in the press by the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) with the latest personalizing their attacks on President Muhammadu Buhari. “This is an uncalled for attack on the administration that crosses the line in a democracy. A call for disobedience to government is a call to anarchy and should not be called opposition politics. “Seeing people go down as the PDP and its leaders are heading to in the elections is pitiful but to seek to bring down the roof on everyone is tragic, selfish and the height of desperation. Happily, these acts do not reflect the true feeling of citizens across the whole nation, and that is why the PDP is sinking deeper and deeper into oblivion. They are losing membership in droves and their campaign is just a caricature of a proper campaign. “It is high time Nigerians separated the chaff floating around in the air in the name of opposition from the crude and disgraceful invective being thrown personally at President Muhammadu Buhari. “The problem of the opposition is that they are not talking about solutions. Rather, each of them, led in the pack by the PDP, is an expert at counting problems. That is the reason why the voting population is coming around to the Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC). “For years, the PDP had been a bastion of corruption and impunity and it is difficult for them to change from their rentier way of life in the nation’s affairs. But CHANGE has come, and has come to stay.”
