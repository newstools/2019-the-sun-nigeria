You will agree with me that the closer government is to the people, the more impactful and meaningful the activities of government will be to them. “Therefore, this inauguration is an integral and essential part of the good governance that we promised the people of Oyo State.” Makinde noted that the caretaker chairmen now occupy unique positions as a link between the state government and the people, adding that “Ideally, you are the first point of call that should address the governance issues of the people before escalating same to higher authorities.”
