Speaking to Sunday Sun via telephone, Chief Executive Officer, Cowry Asset Management, Johnson Chukwu, noted that sentiments remained bearish this week as a result of the macroeconomic situation of the country. “Investors are becoming cautious because the situation of the economy is presently weak, but be that as it may we should begin to see gains before the year runs out”, he said. However, Analysts at Afrinvest said: “In the coming week, we expect market performance to remain bearish due to profit-taking activities and the absence of economic buffers”. Cordros Capital on their part said: “In our view, given the risk-off sentiment dominating the domestic market, we expect the market to shed points in the coming week, except we see a policy-driven catalyst. “Nevertheless, valuations remain attractive, hence we expect pockets of gains over the final weeks of the year as fund and portfolio managers realign portfolios prior to the start of 2020”.
