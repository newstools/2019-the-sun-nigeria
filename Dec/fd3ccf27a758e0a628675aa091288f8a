THOUSANDS of runners who are beneficiaries of the Executive Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s decision to pay their registration fee for the 2020 Access Bank Lagos City Marathon have expressed their gratitude to the governor and other sponsors supporting runners to participate in the race slated for Febru- ary 8, 2020. “After having so much fun and imbibing the culture of running and general exercise from participating in the first four editions of the Access Bank Lagos City Marathon, I was looking forward to participating in the fifth until they introduced a fee. I gave up my dream of running the fifth edition until the cheering news came last month after the press conference that Governor Sanwo- Olu has stated that he will pay on our behalf. I was glad when I heard the news. I followed up and got a form free. I thank the governor for making my dream come true. God bless him,” Iyabo Lawal, a student of a tertiary institution, told our correspondent. Free from the first edition in 2015, the management of Access Bank Lagos City Marathon, now an IAAF Silver Label Race, had to introduce registration fee in compli- ance with IAAF/AIMS regulations for all label races. A registration fee of N5, 000 was introduced for the full Marathon and the 10km race for Nigerians, while foreigners will pay $100 for any of the races. Access Bank, the headline sponsors, Seven-up Bottling Company, Revolution Plus Properties and other sponsors and partners were paying registration fees for thousands of runners.
