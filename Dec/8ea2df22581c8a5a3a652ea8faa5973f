Other awardees at the glamorous event include Ray Power FM, FRCN, Metro FM, The Punch, The Guardian, New Telegraph, Business Day, and TVC News among other reputable media platforms. Speaking on the honour, Mr. Wale Adenuga Jnr., producer, Superstory, says: “From the moment Superstory: Donaldo hit the television screens in the late 2018, viewers told us about how ground-breaking it was. Without sacrificing its entertainment value, the story goes into details and enlightens viewers on how to avoid falling victim to several types of crimes and scams. We appreciate NMMA for this award, and our advertisers and sponsors for the continued partnership.
