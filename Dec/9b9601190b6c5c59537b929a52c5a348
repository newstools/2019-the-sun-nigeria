 Desmond Mgboh, Kano  Kano Integrity Forum on the Creation of New Emirates has disagreed with the Bashir Othman Tofa-led, 12 elders in the state on the creation of additional councils, saying that all evidence indicates that the advantage of the new policy outweighs its disadvantages, Led by Professor Abdul Salihi, a one time commissioner in the state, the Forum said that the decision by  Governor Abdullah Umar Ganduje  was in line with efforts to make Kano modern in the  eyes of Nigerians and the world. Speaking at the press center of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) in the state, the professor maintained that they were delighted that, “due process has now been followed in enacting the enabling law for the creation  of  the new emirates” He insisted that since independence, Kano had been faced with numerous challenges such as the inability to split into more states  as well as creation of more emirates, adding that the new policies would lead to  job creation, balanced development, improved security, health care delivery, qualitative  education and agriculture development He revealed that the state government was committed to the reconstruction of the state and the emirate councils considering the glaring examples from sister states such as Jigawa,Yobe, Oyo and Bauchi states where such splits had recoreded tremendous developmental successes “Kano State is ours and we have no better place than it. We should therefore put  our hands on deck to support Kano State government  and the emirate councils to achieve our coming goal,” he stated.
