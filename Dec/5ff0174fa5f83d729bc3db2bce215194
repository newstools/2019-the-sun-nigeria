Nunieh, who was represented by the Commission’s Director of Agriculture and Fisheries,  George Ero, stated that the project was in agreement with the Federal Government’s agricultural policy and the strategic framework for youth employment and job creation. According to Nunieh, the LIFE-ND project, to be implemented in the nine Niger Delta states, was anchored on the strategic framework that addressed the large and growing number of restless unemployed youths, particularly in rural areas. She said: “LIFE-ND is planned with a financing gap of six years. It has both the first phase of six years, with parallel finance from NDDC to the tune of US$30million, and an additional six years to be financed in the future by other partners or additional IFAD loan. “This project is meant for the Niger Delta region and the essence of this launch is to create more awareness about the project and to make the people realize how much the government of the daycares about their welfare in the area of job creation, food security and improved standard of living. There is no better time than now for a project like this to be launched. The region needs to take it more seriously and harness maximally the expected benefits of this project”.
