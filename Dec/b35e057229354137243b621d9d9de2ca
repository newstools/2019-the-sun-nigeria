Accolades have greeted this mark of honour and respect for the foremost nationalist. Governor Ihedioha announced the renaming of the dual carriage road  at the 90th birthday celebration of the foremost nationalist held at the Sam Mbakwe Hall, Imo Concorde Hotels, Owerri, yesterday. “Dr. Amaechi is an icon, one of the founding fathers of the nation whose contributions to nationhood should not be overlooked. “Dr. Amaechi remains an inspiration, who stood and defended those  principles that remain valuable to nation building.” Mbazulike Amechi a native of Ukpor in Nnewi South Local Government Area of Anambra State, played significant role in nationalist movements that led to the attainment of Nigeria’s independence.
