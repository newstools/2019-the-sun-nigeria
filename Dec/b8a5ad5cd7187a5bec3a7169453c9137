Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja World Heavyweight Boxing Champion Anthony Joshua is to present his title belts to President Muhammadu Buhari at a yet to be decided date. The Minister of Sports, Sunday Dare, said he briefed the Federal Executive Council, presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Wednesday, about Joshuaâ€™s win. Joshua regained his titles from Mexican Andy Ruiz Jr during a repeat match in Saudi Arabia last Saturday. Joshua, who suffered a shock defeat to the Mexican-American at Madison Square Garden six months ago, became heavyweight champion once again by unanimous decision from the judges in Diriyah.
