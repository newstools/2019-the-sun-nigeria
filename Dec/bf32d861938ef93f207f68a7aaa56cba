Fire yesterday destroyed 15 shops and damaged other property at the Owode-Oniri Market in Lagos State. The Director-General, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Dr Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, said at the scene that the fire started at 10.27am. A LASEMA team was on hand to put out the fire. Oke-Osanyintolu said that the fire emanated from one of the several lines of shops in the market. “The cause of the fire is still unknown as there is no power supply within the market. No life was lost but valuable items were destroyed, though the spread of fire is being curtailed. We have counted the shops, about 15 of them were gutted by fire,” he said. Oke-Osanyintolu said that the fire started from the metal section of the market, making traders to call 767/112 channel of the agency. He said that LASEMA coordinated the response to the fire, adding that it got support from the  Lagos State Fire Service and market union officials.
