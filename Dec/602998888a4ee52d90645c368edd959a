Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State has received the new payslip for the state civil servants from the state Ministry of Finance. Presenting the new payslip to the governor, Commissioner for Finance, Alhaji Abdussamad Dasuki, said the change in the new payslip was as a result of the 2017 biometric census conducted for the state civil servants. Dasuki explained that more than 19,321 civil servants were properly captured in the biometric data with their pictures embossed. He, however, said that no fewer than 10,000 of them whose pictures were not captured during the exercise would be invitedÂ  later to have their pictures captured. The commissioner, who said that the measure was aimed at promoting transparency and accountability in the state, assured that each civil servant would be issued with the new payslip. Tambuwal lauded the commissioner and his team for a job well done. Also, the Commissioner for Science and Technology, Dr Kulu Abubakar, presented a plaque of the second runner up position won by the state representatives at the ICT presentation and adoption, held in Abuja.
