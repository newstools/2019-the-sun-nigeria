President Muhammadu Buhari has been lauded over the recent appointment of Dr. Ismail Adewusi as the Postmaster-General. Commenting the president, Mr Akinyemi Akinlabi, a former Chairman of Ibarapa Central Local Government Council in Oyo State, who gave the commendation in a statement made available to the News Agency of Nigeria on Thursday in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, described Adewusi, a former Chairman of Ibile Holdings, as a first-class economist, management expert, and politician, who had over the years contributed to the socio-economic development of the country. Adewusi, a former Commissioner for Finance in Lagos State, was recently appointed as Postmaster-General and Chief Executive Officer of Nigerian Postal Service. Akinlabi described Adewusi’s appointment as a big end-of-the-year gift to the nation, saying the appointee would, no doubt, transform the parastatal into one of the country’s cash-cow. He said: “With this appointment, Nigerians should expect a return to the era of mails delivery at homes and offices, as it used to be in the country before. “The ability and determination of the appointee to improve the efficiency and service delivery of NIPOST are not in doubt. “I am sure the citizens’ confidence in NIPOST will be restored and redeveloped.”
