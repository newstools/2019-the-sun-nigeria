The Rivers State Government has applauded West Africa’s leading independent chemicals, oil and gas, as well as engineering solutions company, Eunisell, for its consistency in sponsoring Nigeria Professional Football League side, Rivers United. Permanent Secretary, in the State Ministry of Sports, James Enebeli, hailed the brand during the second Eunisell Rivers United Day celebration, in the Rivers State capital, Port Harcourt. “It is not easy to invest consistently in a club, since 2015, from Sharks, now Rivers United, that has not actually won laurels to commensurate with the money on them. It demonstrates your commitment to promoting the club,” Enebeli, who was represented by Director of Sports Development, Prudence I. Harry, said. Speaking earlier, Eunisell Group Managing Director, Chika Ikenga, who was represented at the event by Chief Marketing Officer, Dipo Ogunbiyi, revealed that the “rationale for the sponsorship of the club remains unchanged. Eunisell, like any Nigerian, is passionate about Nigerian football, our own clubs playing in the professional league and, of course, the players.” In addition, he said: “Football in Nigeria provides more than entertainment value for a large percentage of the population. For many players and aspiring youngsters in school, it is a way, if not the only way of making a living. Rivers United General Manager, Okey Kpalukwu, equally hailed Eunisell and assured that the club will represent the brand well in the 2019/2020 season.
