They can then make a U-turn before Ogere town and continue their journey to Lagos “Vehicles coming from Abeokuta leading to the eastern part of Nigeria via Ijebu Ode should avoid the Sagamu Interchange Bridge and turn right immediately after Nestle Company PLC to proceed to the expressway leading to Lagos and they can then make a U-turn after Kara-Sagamu after the Julius Berger Yard, Sagamu to reconnect the Sagamu- Ijebu Ode-Ore-Benin Expressway. “The FRSC regrets the inconveniences this may cause motorists.”
