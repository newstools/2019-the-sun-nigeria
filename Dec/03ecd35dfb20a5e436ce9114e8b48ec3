Pastor Enoch Adeboye, General Overseer, Redeemed Christian Church of God, has urged Nigerians to exercise divine faith in order to attract God’s intervention in the challenges. Adeboye gave the charge on Saturday morning during the 2019 Holy Ghost Congress holding at the Redemption Camp, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. He said that Nigerians should trust God for solutions to whatever challenges they were facing. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the week-long event, which began on Monday, has the theme: “The Great Turnaround”. The pastor further stated that God loves to spring surprises, saying, “Nigerians should tap into this character for their turnaround.” Adeboye who took his sermon from Mark 10: 46-52, the story of blind Bartimaeus said “our turnaround and blessings begin the moment we say enough is enough.” “The moment we say no to suffering, sickness, loneliness, fruitless efforts and barrenness in our lives, our turnaround begins. “ As you go out today, remember the story of blind Bartimaeus; problems are not limited to poor homes, you will be amazed that many area boys are from wealthy homes. “Let us say without any doubt that we are tired of suffering, the devil does not respect titles, sickness does not recognise that you have doctorate degrees,” he said. Adeboye announced that 36 children had been delivered at the campground, comprising 22 boys and 14 girls. (NAN)
