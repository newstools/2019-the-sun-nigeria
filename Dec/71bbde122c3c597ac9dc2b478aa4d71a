Speaking to Sunday Sun, a stockbroker who craved anonymity, noted that the week saw investors retreating back as they are preparing for the Santa Claus rally in the coming days. “These investors had to retreat because they feel that they would be able to get more buys and make more sells during the coming week and so this is just a one-off as we expect to see some gains recorded”, he said. Cordros Capital in their weekly assessment, said: “In our view, given the risked off sentiment dominating the domestic market, we expect the market to shed points in the coming week, except we see a policy-driven catalyst. “Nevertheless, valuations remain attractive, hence we expect pockets of gains over the final month of the year as fund and portfolio managers realign portfolios prior to the start of 2020”.
