Mrs Eniola Ambekemo, the Coordinator, National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in Oyo, has expressed concern over the safety of corps members traveling during the Christmas celebrations. According to a statment issued in Ibadan on Saturday, Ambekemo expressed the fear when she visited the Sector Commander, FRSC, Oyo Command, Mr Uche Chukwurah, in his office. She was said to have called for collaboration between the two organisations towards protecting corps members from accidents during the festive period. Ambekemo further stated that NYSC and FRSC had a long standing partnership aimed at promoting good road safety awareness and standards, using corps members. “We have both enjoyed a cordial relationship, especially in actualising our campaign against road traffic accidents,” she stated. She recalled that NYSC Director-General, Brig.-Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim, recently visited the FRSC Corps Marshall in line with the efforts to form effective synergy in promoting road safety. “As part of this effort, I have met with other stakeholders, including the National Union of Road Transport Workers. We want our corps members to be safe,” she said. Responding, Chukwurah pledged the command’s continued support for NYSC and corps members serving in the state.
She said the FRSC would be an eye for the NYSC scheme in its bid to ensure the safety of corps members. “Corps members are a source of pride to the nation, we are committed to ensuring their safety,” she said. She urged corps members in the state to always wear their uniforms, wherever they were, for easy identification.(NAN)
