Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa As part of its transition programme, the administration of Governor Henry Seriake Dickson has concluded plans to render account of its eight-year sojourn at Creek Haven, the state seat of power. The State Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Daniel Iworiso-Markson, made this known at the monthly transparency briefing which held at the Conference Room, Ministry of Finance, Treasury Building, Yenagoa. He said the governmen deemed it necessary to remind Bayelsans yet again, and for the last time about what it did in the various sectors that had placed the state on a fast lane of development. According to him, the weeklong programme, which  will be part of the handover ceremony will be tagged ‘Stewardship’ and will also provide a unique opportunity for the incoming administration to take off. Iworiso-Markson stressed that the elaborate programme will equally serve as an appraisal exercise as commissioners and heads of key parastatals and agencies will take turns to make their presentations in graphic details. He spoke further: “Through the purposeful leadership of Governor Dickson, Bayelsa has been set on an unstoppable trajectory of growth and development that will continue to be seen in the coming years. The Restoration Government has indeed been one that has instilled decency and accountability into the governance of the state as never seen before. Bayelsans should expect proper accountability of our stewardship during the programme as every Commissioner and heads of agencies will come before the people to present their scorecard.” The Special Adviser to the Governor on Treasury, Revenue and Accounts, Mr. Timipre Seipulou, presented the income and expenditure profile of the state for the month of October, 2019. He announced a total inflow of N19.86 billion comprising statutory allocation of N3.3 billion, derivation N10.47 billion and value added tax N5.2 billion.
