Ighalo, before now made the five-man shortlist following his impres- sive display which earned him the 2019 AFCON golden boot. The Chinese-based striker has been sidelined for Algerian Riyad Mahrez, Senegalese Sadio Mane and Egyptian Mohamed Salah for the top three jostling for the gong. CAF via his official twitter handle display the trio with a caption, “Almost two weeks to the big day! #CAFAwards2019 and then there are 3! @ MoSalah, @Mahrez22, @ Sadio Mane.” Aside Ighalo, Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, who tutored the three-time African champions to a third place finish at the 2019 AFCON in Egypt, was also dropped ahead of the award night.
