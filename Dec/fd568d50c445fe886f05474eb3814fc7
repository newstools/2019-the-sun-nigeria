Tony John, Port Harcourt Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has been declared the best among governors in Nigeria, in terms of fiscal development and people-oriented projects in the state. The State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Felix Obuah, stated this yesterday, while playing host to a cross-section of youth leaders, in Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni Local Government Area of the state. Obuah said his assessment stemmed from careful evaluation of Governor Wike’s sterling performance less than six months after his second term inauguration. He averred that, while the ovation that greeted Wike’s remarkable and excellent achievements during his first four-year tenure was yet to die down, he is already working to repeat history with projects on ground. “Governor Nyesom Ezenwo Wike of Rivers State is the best governor in terms of infrastructural development, security, regular payment of salaries and entitlements to civil servants in the State, among others. “As if that is not enough, ‘Mr. Quality Projects’ pushed his good governance policy with construction of three flyovers simultaneously”, the State PDP Chairman stated. Obuah further affirmed that the state chief executive has restored absolute peace in the 23 local government areas of the state, adding that his favourable disposition towards non-indigenes, has made Rivers  home for all Nigerians. He called on youths in the state to support the governor and charged them to shun violence.
