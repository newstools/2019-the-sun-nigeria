According to a local report, the mini-estate is located in Avenida de Liberdade area of the Lisbon and it incredibly boasts 288 square metres, with 3,100 square feet. With eye-catching features including a spa and indoor swimming pool, the £6million-worth luxury apartment also has an exciting gym, latest electro domestics and three large bedrooms. The privacy-giving apartment was reportedly built ten years ago when the Juventus star was at Manchester United. And because of its proximity to the neighborhood where Ronaldo began his football career as a young ambitious footballer in Portugal, the site was said to have become a tourist place for local footballers.
