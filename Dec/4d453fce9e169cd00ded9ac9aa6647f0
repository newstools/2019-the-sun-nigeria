 Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday in Daura, Katsina State, said Nigeria’s socio-economic and political salvation will come from education, urging citizens to embrace learning as a way of life while the government will do its best to provide access. According to a statement by Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, Buhari made the call while being honoured in his country home in an event to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of Community Secondary School, Daura. He recalled how he became an orphan at a young age, but his nine years in boarding school and joining the army shaped his life. The president and five others founded the Community Secondary School as a community service. “I spent nine years in the boarding school where the teachers showered us with love, care and total commitment. They treated us as their own children. “They commended us when we did well, and flogged us on bare buttocks if we misbehaved,” he said. The president praised the current management of the school, which is now renamed Pilot Secondary School, Daura, for maintaining high standards. Buhari implored the old boys association to carry on the good work they were going, leading up to the current position of the school. The leader of the team, Alhaji M.T Bature, the Sarkin Kudu of Katsina, said the vision of the founding fathers, including the president, had ensured the success of so many sons of the state, with many growing up to become professors, engineers, doctors and military generals.
