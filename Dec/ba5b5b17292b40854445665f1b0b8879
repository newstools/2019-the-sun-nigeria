The Police Command in Kogi has banned the use of firecrackers across the state. The state Commissioner of police, Mr Akeem Busari, announced the ban in a statement in Lokoja on Friday. The statement signed by the command’s Public Relations Officer, DSP William Aya, quoted Busari as saying that the ban on the use of firecrackers was due to the threat it posed to security of lives and property. He admonished parents and guardians to restrain their children and wards from the use of the devices throughout the festive season. “Anybody caught using the knockout will be arrested and prosecuted,” he warned. The command advised all law abiding citizens to go about their lawful businesses, warning that the command would not hesitate to apply the full wrath of law against any persons that took the law into their hands. It assured the people of adequate security before, during and after the Yuletide. It appealed to the people to support the police and other security agencies with timely and credible information on the activities of criminal elements. (NAN)
