A 40- year-old civil servant, Alani Taofeeq, on Friday appeared before an Abeokuta Magistrates’ Court for allegedly defrauding three men of N275,000 on the pretences of helping them to buy motorcycles.  Taofeeq, who resides  at No. 12, Soluade St., Ijeun Tuntun area of Abeokuta, is facing a two-count charge of fraud and stealing.  The prosecutor, Insp. Olu-balogun Lawrence, told the court that the defendant committed the offences on Jan. 4, at about 8:00p.m., at One Aregbe area in Abeokuta.  Lawrence said the defendant collected the sum of N105,000 from one  Mr Ogunjobi Rasaq on the  pretence that he would  help him  buy two motorcycles from the Ogun Ministry of Forestry.  The defendant  had claimed that the ministry was auctioning some goods.  He said that the defendant also collected the sum of N45,000 from  Mr Abdullahi Jubril and N125,000 from Mr Ogun Mukailia on  the pretence that he would also help them to purchase  two motorcycles.  The defendant had told his victims that the purchase would be through auction sales from his office where he was  working as a driver.  He said the defendant converted the money into his personal use while efforts by the complainants to get the motorcycles or retrieve their monies  proved abortive.  He said that Toafeeq was arrested and handed over to the police.  The prosecutor said that  the offences contravened Sections 419 and 319 of the Criminal Laws of Ogun, 2006.  The defendent, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges.  The magistrate, Mr Olakunleyin Oke, granted the defendant bail in the sum of  N250,000 with two sureties in like sum.  Oke said the sureties must be gainfully employed and  provide evidence of tax payment to the Ogun Government.  He then  adjourned the case until Jan. 8,2020  for trial. (NAN)
