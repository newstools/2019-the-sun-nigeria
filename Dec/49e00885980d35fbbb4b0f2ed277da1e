One suspected thug (name withheld by us) that came in company with the speaker shot sporadically and the bullets hit four members of our party, the PDP. One person died in the process and as I am speaking with you, three of our members who sustained gunshot wounds have been brought to the state teaching hospital in Ado-Ekiti.
