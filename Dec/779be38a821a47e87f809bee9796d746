Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has said  no fewer than six million people, mostly youths are venturing into rice production following the impact of the border closure on rice value chain. The minister disclosed this on Thursday in Kano when he led a stakeholder in the rice production to the state Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Mohammed, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Sabo Nanono, are in Kano on assessment tour of the impact of the border drill on the entire rice production value chain. “Before the drill, which some people have referred to as border closure, there were 12.2 million rice farmers in Nigeria, according to the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN). “The farmers were cultivating rice twice a year. Now, many rice farmers across the country have started three-times-a-year cultivation in order to meet the increasing demand. “Not only that, at least 6 million people, mostly youths, are now venturing into rice production, meaning that we could hit 18 million rice farmers in no time if the present trend continues,” he said Mohammed said that Nigeria’s quest to achieve self sufficiency in rice production will be hastened by the increasing activities in the rice production value chain brought about by the border drill. He added that self sufficiency in rice production would also translate to more jobs for millions of people as well as cheaper and more nutritious rice for all. “We can now tell you, without mincing words, that the border drill has impacted positively on rice production in the country,” he said.
