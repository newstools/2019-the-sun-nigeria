Tony Osauzo And Ighomuaye Lucky, Benin National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and immediate past governor of Edo State, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, yesterday, debunked reports that he was under house arrest by security agents. He stated this at his Okorotun residence in Benin City when Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu was presented to him by the APC National Vice Chairman, (South-South), Hiliard Eta, shortly after the former PDP governorship candidate and his political associates were received into the party. Oshiomhole who was absent at the rally where Ize-Iyamu was received, explained that he chose not to attend the rally because he has decided to toe the path of peace. You will have tension when you find that local party members are fighting each other because the party membership you can remain there as long as you obey the rules of the party. There is no limit of tenure for example, for being a member of APC but there is limit for being chairman, there is limit for being governor, there is a limit of tenure for being president but there is no limit for being a member. So, once our members are united, I am comfortable but we will sustain the path of peace that was the only reason I opted not to attend the mega rally today. They have already planted a story today from the government house that I am under house arrest”, he said. The APC National Chairman  said he believes that God will always help him and that the party has come to stay for the interest of the people of the state. “So, either way, they want to make me look like a he-goat. You know the proverbial he-goat, when the family child is sick in the traditional Nigerian society, you go and consult oracle who asks you to go and sacrifice it to appease the gods so that the witches and wizards will not kill the child but on the other hand when a baby is born or they are celebrating birthday, they have to get the he-goat to slaughter to celebrate.
