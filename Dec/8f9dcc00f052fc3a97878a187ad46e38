Chidi Obineche For keen observers of Nigeria’s First and Second Republic, the name Mbazulike Amechi rings a bell. “The boy is good” as he is known by his political peers, was one of the foremost nationalists and crusaders of an independent Nigeria. Mbazulike Amechi was famed to have hid the foremost South African nationalist and former president, Nelson Mandela for six months in his house in Nigeria to evade arrest by officials of the then apartheid regime in South Africa. Renowned for his oratory skills and love for education, “The boy is good” was also a known political strategist, trade unionist, first class Zikist, politician, former Minister of Aviation in the first republic, author, advocate of rural development, statesman, sportsman, worthy son of Igboland and a proud nationalist. On December 30, 2019, Mbazulike Amechi, also known as Dara Akunwafor, will mark his 90th birthday, though he was born in June. The event, which promises to be grand, would be celebrated in Owerri, Imo State and would be hosted by the Imo State governor and co-hosted by the other South-East and South-South governors. Double sapphire which signifies a 90th anniversary or birthday is a landmark. Sapphire is a transparent precious stone that symbolises wisdom, virtue, good fortune, royalty and it is believed to protect wearers from illness. These qualities aptly capture the life and times of Mbazulike Amechi, one of the few surviving Nigerian nationalists worth celebrating given his contributions to the socio-political and economic emancipation of Nigeria. Born on June 16, 1929, at Ukpor in the present day Nnewi South Local Government Area, Mbazulike Amechi  attended the Roman Catholic Schools at Ukpor and Ozubulu from 1937-43.
