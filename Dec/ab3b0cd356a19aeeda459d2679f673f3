Everton are keeping tabs on one-cap Nigeria international Josh Maja, according to reports emanating from the French press. French journalist Ignazio Genuardi has tweeted that the Toffees made a check on the former Sunderland starlet during Bordeaux’s 1-0 loss to Strasbourg on December 15 and added that other unnamed Premier League clubs are watching the striker. Chelsea have been credited with an interest in the 20-year-old ahead of the reopening of the transfer window. Maja has the honour of being the only Nigeria-eligible player to score a hat-trick in Europe’s top five leagues this season, achieving the feat in Bordeaux’s 6-0 rout of Nîmes Olympique on December 3. The fact that the Bordeaux number nine shares the same agent as Everton’s Alex Iwobi and ex-Toffees winger Ademola Lookman gives credence to the reports of a possible move to Goodison Park.
