Uche Usim, Abuja The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) on Sunday disclosed that it recorded N5.2 billion trading surplus in August.

The new figures are contained in the recently released August 2019 edition of the NNPC Monthly Financial and Operations Report (MFOR) of the National Oil Company.
