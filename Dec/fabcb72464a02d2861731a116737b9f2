It would be recalled that on November 12, 2019, the state governor, Samuel Ortom presented a budget of N189,483,511,025 to the House for the 2020 fiscal year. Christened “Budget of Advancement, Growth and Development,” the governor said the budget would ensure adequate provision for implementation of programmes that impact positively on the economy and accelerate growth as well as ensure completion of on-going projects and the consistent payment of emoluments. However, the Assembly approved the passage after considering and adopting the reports and recommendations of House Standing Committee on Appropriation presented at plenary by its Chairman, Hon.
