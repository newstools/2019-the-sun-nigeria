Taiwo Awoniyi who currently plays for Bundesliga side FC Mainz is being owned by Liverpool after signing for the club since 2015.

Alabi called on Awoniyi to make discipline his watchword to excel in his career pledging that the government would encourage youth to realise their potential. While responding, Taiwo Awoniyi thanked the Deputy Governor for his fatherly advise and also promised to abide by it. He expressed appreciation to the Government for returning Kwara United to the Premier league. Awoniyi pledged to always give back to the society. The 22-year-old player then presented his club jersey to the Deputy Governor who then promised to come and watch one of his game this season in Germany.
