Onoriode “Godzilla” Ehwariemi of Nigeria has vowed to defeat his Argentine opponent, Argentina’s Ariel “Chiquito” Baracamonte, when they clash for the World Boxing Federation (WBF) Intercontinental heavyweight title, at GOtv Boxing Night 20. The clash will headline the nine-bout boxing show, which holds on December 28, at the Tafawa Balewa Square, Lagos. The show will also feature live musical performances by Zlatan Ibile, Mayorkun and Ortisefemi, among other artistes. Speaking after his training in Lagos, yesterday, Godzilla, whose 18 fights have yielded 17 victories by knockout and one loss, said he is aiming to win the title for Nigeria. “This fight is a fight for my country. I will do everything legitimate to ensure the belt comes to Nigeria. Argentina tends to beat us at football and I intend to summon the spirit that propelled Nigeria to win the gold medal at the 1996 Olympic Games to avenge our numerous defeats by Argentina on the football pitch,” he said. The hulking ring artist said he is familiar with Argentine boxers, having had nine fights in the country. While he is fighting Chiquito for the first time, he, however claimed to be familiar with his strengths and weakness through videos of his previous fights.
