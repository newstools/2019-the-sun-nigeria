Wladimir Klitschko has once more caught the attention of the boxing public by dropping comeback hints on social media. The former long-reigning two-time heavyweight world champion took to Twitter on Saturday afternoon, teasing three possible opponents for a return. The tweets read: “Let me entertain you with this and you can like it or not, Fury/Joshua/Wilder vs Klitschko.” Klitschko’s first message, featuring Fury’s name, attracted the most attention from followers with many seemingly wanting to see the Ukrainian finally get his shot at revenge over the ‘Gypsy King’. After Fury beat Klitschko in 2015, he then had a long period of inactivity due to personal problems and was unable to fulfil the rematch that was owed in their contract. As a result, Wladimir ended up facing Joshua in their 2017 thriller, which AJ won by eleventh-round knockout. The only man of the three who Klitschko hasn’t faced before is America’s WBC heavyweight champion Wilder. As things stand he is currently set to rematch Fury next, while AJ must deal with his mandatory challengers.
