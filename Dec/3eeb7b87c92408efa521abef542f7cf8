Analysts say the volatility in the market is due to investors realigning their portfolios after counting their 2019 losses.
A source at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), said: “Right now, these investors have gone back to the drawing board to see how they can shake their portfolios. The economy in 2019 has been so bad, but not all that bad for the nation’s capital market because the regulators have made good strides this year”. Cordros Capital in their weekly note to Sunday Sun said: “We see the level of activity and volatility being sustained over the final days of the year, with some pockets of gains expected, as fund and portfolio managers realign portfolios prior to the start of 2020”.
