Anthony Joshua has reportedly been rocked and hurt in sparring ahead of his rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr. The heavyweight will bid to win back his three heavyweight world titles against the Mexican-American in Saudi Arabia on Saturday. Joshua was dropped four times in the rivals’ first fight in June before being stopped in the seventh round in one of the biggest shocks in boxing history. Immediately after the final bell conspiracy theories circulated suggesting Joshua had been hurt in sparring and had suffered the consequences in the fight. Joey Dawejko was named as the sparring partner who had dropped Joshua but he has never confirmed this publicly. And according to World Boxing News , the Brit has again suffered trouble in his preparations. Albon Pervizaj, Tom Little, Derek Chisora, Andrew Tabiti and Timothy Moten are believed to have shared the ring with the former champion in Sheffield. But the report directly contradicts Moten’s recollection of the 60 rounds he sparred with Joshua. “There have been guys here, I don’t want to say any names, but I’ve seen guys come into camp, get blown away and get sent home that same week,” Moten told Mail Online. “He’s dropped a few of his sparring partners and he’s rocked a lot. Joshua is by far the hardest hitter I’ve been in the ring with. “Almost every session I ask him how he’s doing, what he thinking. He says to me, ‘Ready, ready’. Mentally he is in a good place. I can see that in his eyes. He’s got a focus I’ve not seen. “He’s got that warrior’s spirit. His mentality is to destroy. He is like a focused, caged lion and when the time is right, he will unleash.”
