On their own rights, successful oil tycoon, Jubril Adewale Tinubu, and his lovely wife, Bola, can correctly be described as the authentic power couple. Though, not always in your face, the couple is famous, accomplished and obviously happy and productive everyday. Despite being a darling wife to a super-rich dude, Bola has proven to all that money doesn’t always change you. Unlike some of her fellow billionaires’ wives who love flashier lifestyle, she lives a fairly quiet life and rarely seen at most high society parties. But her breathtaking philanthropic interest has impacted several lives. On Wednesday—Christmas Day— the adorable couple marked their wedding anniversary amidst torrents of  messages from friends and family members. In her own message, Bola, on her social media handles, described her hubby, Wale as “My Rock”. A successful corporate lawyer with a tight schedule, Bola is reputed to juggle between running her home, attending to her businessman’s hubby’s need and still oversees the need and welfare of her five lovely children. However, some days earlier, the couple has had a momentous week ahead of their wedding anniversary. Bola has had an amazing privilege of hosting International supermodel, Naomi Campbell, who stopped by at her Cece Yara Foundation office to learn about the work the organization is doing with children experiencing sexual abuse. She has been named by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in its 2018 list, as one of 100 inspirational and influential women from around the world. And on the part of the fun-loving hubby, Wale, he had let down his hair when he hosted his numerous staff at Oando Plc and select friends to an ultimate End of the Year Denim Party at The Wings along Ozumba Mbadiwe Avenue, Victoria Island, Lagos. At the party, the billionaire oil mogul played host to African Giant crooner, Burna Boy, who serenaded Oando staffs and their guests.
