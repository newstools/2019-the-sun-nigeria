The Metropolitan and Primate of the Church of Nigeria, Anglican Communion, Most Rev. Nicholas Okoh has advised the Federal  Government  to support and work together with the Nigerian media, for a better and progressive Nigeria.

He said  the government and the press should work together, because “the citizenry is the subject of both the government and the press.” The Primate, saw the press as a crusader working for the people, also the government saying that there should be synergy between the government and the press for ultimate result in the development of the country. On the security situation in Nigeria, Okoh stated that the security in a democracy was the responsibility of the government, and that the government should be encouraged to ensure that the security of the nation was paramount. “If we degenerate into militia groups because of what we are experiencing in the country today, there will be no more Nigeria, it will be dog eating dog. So, even though the security implementation is not perfect, we should keep on urging the government to do better, than for individuals to take laws into their hands,” he said. Sir  Folu Olamiti, Chairman, Management Board of ACNN, while speaking with journalists after the rebranding of the television station, explained that with the programme contents of the television station, they hoped to improve with high velocity in giving out their best to their teeming viewers He said that the programme contents of the station would be edifying to everybody that took  time to watch ,  adding that being a faith based station, that more entertaining and educative contents had been added for both adults and children.
