A sociopolitical organisation, FOCUS 2023, has faulted recent statement credited to some prominent northerners that the gentleman agreement on the rotational president was no longer tenable. Prof. Ango Abdullahi, chairman of Northern Elders Forum, Alhaji Tanko Yakassai and  Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State had  suggested that the deal of 1999 to rotate the position of the president between the South and the North had outlived its usefulness and should be  discarded. In a statement by tProtem Chairman, Alhaji Ore Salako, the group frowned at the comments of the notable northern leaders.   “While the principle of rotation is  not a constitutional matter, it was  introduced into our political arrangement  to give each part of the country a sense of belonging following the annulment of the June 12 1992 general elections.  The rotational principle has become one of the ethos on which our  democratic experience is anchored and has  significantly  reduced the suspicion of domination of one part of the country over the other.  This in turn is  promoting trust, nationalistic ideals and  all inclusive party politics” The Group  affirmed that the principle of rotation  should not be abandoned in pursuit of  selfish agenda, but retained by all political parties  in the best  interest of the country. “FOCUS 2023 expressed it determination  to work with like-minded progressives and patriots  across the country  to ensure that the next president  emerges  from Southern Nigeria,” it said.
