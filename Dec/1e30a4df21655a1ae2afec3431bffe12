Ukah stated at the weekend that the sponsors and the government of Delta State have put smiles on the faces of hundreds of young ones in the state. He said: “I was excited to see the young boys display so much skill and enthusiasm all through the tournament. The standard was so high because some schools that did very well at the preliminaries and zonal stage were unable to make the semis or even the quarterfinals. “These young footballers will not forget the experience and I am personally proud to be part of it. The sponsors did tremendously well from day one to the end. I am also happy that the Governor was at the final because it showed how much he cherished the project. Delta is a sports loving state and we are trying to combine education and sports for this young ones to shape their future.”
