Dabiri-Erewa said that five of the students went for the table tennis event  without the knowledge of the Nigerian Table Tennis Federation,  two returned over two weeks ago, three of them stayed back while  one  already applied for asylum. She explained: “Although the Croatia Authorities through our Ambassador in Budapest denied the allegation involving maltreatment by the Croatian Police, the Hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Geoffrey Onyeama has  demanded full investigation into the matter.” The  NIDCOM chair said the conditions attached to their release include usage of their return tickets from Zagreb, Croatia back to Nigeria and must not seek Asylum in Croatia, just as one of them did already. Dabiri-Erewa appealed to Nigerians to always inform relevant authorities whenever they go on such trips outside the country and be of good behaviour. Abia Alexandro Uchenna, Eboh Kenneth Chinedu, and three other students, reportedly arrived in Zagreb, capital of Croatia, on November 12, for the fifth world inter-university championships held in the country.
