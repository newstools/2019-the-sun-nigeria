The management of Ocean Marine Solutions Limited (OMSL) has debunked any knowledge or involvement in the physical attack of the Managing Director of Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Ms. Hadiza Bala Usman, at the National Assembly. NPA boss Ms. Hadiza Usman petitioned the President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Lawan alleging that hoodlums at the premises of the National Assembly in Abuja physically attacked her on Tuesday. She claimed that her attack was sponsored by Chairman of Messrs Ocean Maritime Solutions Limited (OMSL), Captain Wells Okunbo apparently over the decision of the NPA on the Secure Anchorage issue after attending investigative hearing in the Assembly. She said that she was only saved a bigger assault by her security agents who took her into Senator Danjuma Gojeâ€™s office where she waited for the hoodlums to leave. Reacting to the allegation, Commodore Chuma Adogu (rtd), said the allegation was a falsehood and a figment of imagination, saying the Chairman of OMSL, Captain Wells Okunbo, a fine gentleman who has served the nation diligently in various capacities, could not have sponsored thugs to attack the NPA boss. Commodore Adogu noted that on that Tuesday there was no any sign of such alleged attack or rented crowd in the premises of the National Assembly that could warrant such allegation, maintaining that OMSL management came to the National Assembly just like other invited organisations on the day of the investigation by the Joint Committee of the Senate investigating the Secure Anchorage Area (SAA).
