Experts who spoke with Sunday Sun, said that despite the bearish performance, the Nigerian   capital market remains an investment destination while adding that some pocket of gains should be expected prior to the start of the new year.
Chief Executive Officer, Sofunix Investment and Communications, Sola Oni, noted that the capital market operated under a tough economic climate in 2019 as evident in incessant bearish trend until the policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria on Open Market Operations (OMO) crashed yields on fixed income securities.
Oni said that the outlook for the market in 2020 is attractive, but is down to fixing of Nigeria’s weak economy where the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) currently grows at  2.3 per cent while the country’s population grows at 2.6 per cent, which is a misnomer.
“The capital market operated under a tough economic climate in 2019 as evident in incessant bearish trend until the policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria on Open Market Operations (OMO) crashed yields on fixed income securities. “Expectedly, investors took flight for safety and reverted to purchase of equities with multiplier effects on the rise in many performance indicators but still, I will say that the NSE remains an investment destination,” he said. On their part, Cordros Capital, in its weekly note, said: “We see the level of activity and volatility being sustained over the final days of the year, with some pockets of gains expected, as fund and portfolio managers realign portfolios prior to the start of 2020”.
