Allnigeriasoccer.com exclusively reported last month that the Benin-City born attacker has pledged his international future to Nigeria even though he is eligible to represent Eng- land, and was being considered for the U-23 AFCON. It had been feared that he wasnâ€™t going to be released to the Nigeria Football Federation, but Wolves and Wigan Athletic sanctioned his trip to Africa despite the tournament not included on FIFA calendar for international matches.
