After due consultation with all relevant stakeholders, the 2020 budget was prepared and presented to the National Assembly on Tuesday – the earliest in 10 years. While presenting a record N10.33 trillion (about $33.8 billion)budget for 2020, President Buhari, noted that the sum of N8.16 trillion is estimated as the total Federal Government revenue in 2020 and comprises oil revenue N2.64 trillion, non-oil tax revenues of N1.81 trillion and other revenues of N3.7 trillion.
Analysts who spoke to Sunday Sun were of the view that the presentation of the budget did not give investors the confidence that things would change, as such they remained pessimistic which affected the trading sessions.
A stock broker who craved for anonymity, noted that investors’ apathy has increased over time because investors no longer have confidence in the macroeconomic situation of the Nigerian economy.
He said: “Growth has been sluggish and it has not been rapid as we would have expected it to be so a lot of these investors are on the fence and some are now into fixed income rather than equities”.
Cordros Capital in their weekly note, said: “In our view, the trend witnessed through 2019 so far is likely to persist through the fourth quarter, although we expect pockets of gains over the last few weeks of the year as fund managers and portfolio managers realign portfolio prior to the start of 2020”.
