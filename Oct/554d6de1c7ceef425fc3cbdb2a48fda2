Heavyweight champion Andy Ruiz Jr has declared he wants to lose 10lbs before he faces Anthony Joshua again. The Mexican is looking to cut some weight from his 19st 11b frame in a bid to become more mobile before he faces Joshua in Saudi Arabia on December 7. Ruiz had aimed to come in heavy when he faced Joshua the first time around in order to combat the 6ft 6in Brit’s shots. But on this occasion the Mexican has opted to change tactics and has placed all the importance on speed and weighing lighter. ‘I kind of wanted to be a little heavier because Anthony Joshua’s big, I wanted to carry his weight, take the punches well but I think being 10lbs lighter, I’m going to be a better fighter,’ Ruiz said. ‘I’m going to be more faster, let my hands go and be faster on my feet as well. ‘Ten pounds isn’t going to make any difference, if anything it’s going to make me stronger, it’s going to make me faster, especially because he’s going to be running around. ‘I think he’s going to be trying to win by points and my job is to cut the ring and do what we got to do and let my hands go, it’s exactly what we been training on in the gym.’ The 30-year-old delivered one of the greatest shocks of all-time in heavyweight boxing history by flooring Joshua four times before winning in round seven.
