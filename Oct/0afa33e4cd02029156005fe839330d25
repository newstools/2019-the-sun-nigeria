Christopher Oji  The Lagos State Environmental Sanitation and Special Offences Agency (Taskforce) has impounded I34 commercial motorcycles plying restricted routes along CMS, Marina, Apongbon and Yaba. Chairman of the agency, CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi, who paraded the suspects said they were arrested for flouting traffic regulations and riding along restricted routes around CMS, Marina, Apongbon and Yaba. He stated that the agency was compelled to embark on the clampdown following enormous complaints about the illegal activities of the motorcyclists and the rate at which they rode carelessly, thereby putting lives of motorists and pedestrians in danger. CSP Egbeyemi disclosed that  the clampdown would stretch to all axis of Victoria Island, Ajah, Lekki to put a check to the illegal operations and plying on restricted routes . He further said that” the routes are restricted in accordance with the Lagos Traffic Laws which states that every motorcycle operator must wear crash helmets, be above 18 years, not ride on kerb/median/road setbacks, avoid restricted routes, must not carry more than one passenger/pregnant woman/adult with baby/child below 12 years, not install any musical gadgets, must wear an apron, not operate beyond 10 pm, operate with a rider’s permit and have their motorcycle registered with the government. He harped on the recklessness of the ORide motorcyclists who are gradually becoming a problem on the roads, driving against traffic, riding on flyovers and not minding the casualties that might occur. He admonished them to adhere to the Lagos traffic rules if not the agency would be on them.    function insertAfter(e,t){t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t.nextSibling)}function getElementByXPath(e,t){if(!t)t=document;if(t.evaluate)return t.evaluate(e,document,null,9,null).singleNodeValue;while(e.charAt(0)=="/")e=e.substr(1);var n=t;var r=e.split("/");for(var i=0;i<r.length;i++){var a=r[i].split(/(\w*)\[(\d*)\]/gi).filter(function(e){return!(e==""||e.match(/\s/gi))},this);var l=a[0];var o=a[1]?a[1]-1:0;if(i<r.length-1)n=n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o];else return n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o]}}if(!Array.prototype.filter){Array.prototype.filter=function(e){var t=this.length>>>0;if(typeof e!="function"){throw new TypeError}var n=[];var r=arguments[1];for(var i=0;i<t;i++){if(i in this){var a=this[i];if(e.call(r,a,i,this)){n.push(a)}}}return n}}function injectWidgetByXpath(e){var t=getElementByXPath(e);if(t==null){t=document.getElementById("tbdefault")}innerInject(t)}function injectWidgetByMarker(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);innerInject(t.parentNode)}function innerInject(e){var t=document.createElement("span");var n=document.createElement("script");var r="if JS crashes here, the first innerHTML value should be enclosed with single quotes instead of double, go to the minified version and change it";t.innerHTML="<div id='taboola-below-article'></div><div id='taboola-below-article-second'></div>";n.innerHTML="window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-c', container:'taboola-below-article', placement:'below-article', target_type: 'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-d', container:'taboola-below-article-second', placement:'below-article-2nd', target_type: 'mix'});";insertAfter(t,e);insertAfter(n,t)}injectWidgetByMarker('tbmarker');
