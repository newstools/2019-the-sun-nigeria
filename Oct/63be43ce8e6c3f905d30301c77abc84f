Fermented foods are foods that have been through a process of lacto-fermentation in which natural bacteria feed on the sugar and starch in the food creating lactic acid. This process preserves the food and creates beneficial enzymes, b-vitamins, Omega-3 fatty acids, and various strains of probiotics. Some foods are not safe for human consumption; it is only through fermentation that the plant toxins in them are removed and it is this process that brings out the best in such foods. Besides the fact that they taste great, there are several great reasons to start making and eating fermented foods: 1. Eating fermented foods will introduce beneficial bacteria into your digestive system and help the balance of bacteria in the system. Probiotics have also been shown to help slow or reverse some diseases, improve bowel health, aid digestion, and improve immunity. 2. Having the proper balance of gut bacteria and enough digestive enzymes helps you absorb more of the nutrients in the foods you eat. Pair this with your healthy food diet, and you will absorb many more nutrients from the foods you eat. You wonâ€™t need as many supplements and vitamins, and you will be absorbing more of the live nutrients in your foods. 3. Incorporating healthy foods into your diet can get expensive, but not so with fermented foods. You can make them at home. Adding these things to your diet can also cut down on the number of supplements you need, helping reduce your budget further. 4. Fermentation allows you to store these foods for longer periods of time without losing the nutrients like you would with traditional canning. 5. Fermentation brings out some amazing health benefits in foods. 6. Fermentation removes anti-nutrients from foods.
