Gernot Rohr is pushing for CAF to shift the date for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier between Nigeria and Benin Republic, earlier scheduled for November 13. Rohr slammed CAF for not showing enough respect to the three times AFCON winners over the game fixture, coming only two days after the international window opens. According to Rohr: “Our game against Benin is on November 13, which is a Wednesday. The FIFA window opens on Monday. When will our players arrive and prepare for this game?” “It is ridiculous. We need to be respected, and I have spoken to CAF’s Anthony Baffoe about it. I have also spoken to Michel Dussuyer, the Benin coach, as well. We need the date to be changed, so that the teams can arrive and train properly, for the game. Match scheduling must be done properly.” Nigeria will play two AFCON qualifying matches next month, against Benin Republic (November 13) and Lesotho (November 19).
