In his tweet, he praised the midfielder for his outstanding goal against Tite’s men and he was glad to see the player extend his bright start to his international career. “Outstanding @J_Aribo19 two goals in two games for the national team” he wrote on his Twitter account. As for Rangers, they were impressed with the way Aribo scored the goal despite the number of Brazil players in the box.
