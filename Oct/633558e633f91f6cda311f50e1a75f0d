Overseas–based professional players, Tom Dele-Bashiru and Orji Okonkwo have joined the camp of the Nigeria U23 team, Olympics Eagles preparing for next month’s U23 Africa Cup of Nations taking place in Egypt. Earlier, midfield lubricator, Kelechi Nwakali, who captained the Golden Eaglets to World Cup glory in Chile four years ago, had rejoined the squad that he helped secure victories over Libya and Sudan in the qualifiers to earn Nigeria a berth at the finals in Egypt. Okonkwo, who plays for Canadian side, Montreal Impact, joined the rest of the team yesterday, as the overseas–based professionals continued to stream into camp ahead of this week’s departure to Egypt. His arrival has given Coach lmama Amapakabo and his assistants more attacking options ahead of the tournament. The Olympic Eagles are expected to leave the country on Thursday for the tournament which holds November 8– 22, in Cairo, with Nigeria playing in Group B, which also has Cote d’Ivoire, Zambia and South Africa. Another oversea–based professional in camp is Tom Dele-Bashiru, who featured for Flying Eagles at the FIFA U20 World Cup finals in Poland in the summer. The 20-year old midfielder plies his trade with English Premier League side, Watford FC, and was born in the city of Manchester, England, to Nigerian parents. He scored Nigeria’s third goal as the Flying Eagles obliterated Qatar 4-0 in their opening game of the FIFA U20 World Cup in Poland.
