With the country facing financial challenges to fund urgent infrastructure and social development, the issue of government revenue leakages and frivolous expenditures by some agencies needs to be curtailed and FRC play a critical role in ensuring this. That is what the Act establishing the commission envisaged and our Committee will be working with the commission during oversights on revenue generating agencies.
