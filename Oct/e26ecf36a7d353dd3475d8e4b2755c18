Taiwo Oluwadare, Ibadan The much awaited online talk show tagged ‘D Home Plan’ with OBA, debuted on Instagram during the week. The debut has so much garnered views and reactions within a short time on Instagram and Facebook due to the focus of the show and the assurance from the host, Omobolanle Adebayo, that it would remain one of the best platforms to enlighten viewers on the fundamental process of building a home from start to finish. According to the host, who has got over 15 years experience in interior decoration and real estate businesses said: “It promises to be captivating and breathtaking. Viewers will get to know “When” “How” and “Where” to invest in real estate. A lot of people already are investors in Real Estate, but majority of them are doing it wrongly. What do I mean? “Assuming someone has, let’s say, 70m to buy a house, he or she can use that amount to do joint venture and get a house and also get profit on it. That’s one of the “How” to invest in Real Estate. For those who don’t know what JOINT-VENTURE is all about: it’s simply an investor and land owner coming together to form a partnership and to develop a property, or properties, as the case maybe.” In the new video, she spoke about how people could get authentic lands free on ‘omo onile brouhaha’ and where to develop a land. She, however, proffers solution to those who are in need of a beautiful interior decoration for their homes and offices.
