(BBC) Nigeria international midfielder Sunday Mba is keen to find a route back into football following an inactive two years. ‪The 30-year-old, who scored the Super Eagles’ winning goal in the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations final, was released by Turkish club Yeni Malatyaspor in September 2017. ‪Mba has not played competitively since his last appearance against Sivasspor in May 2017, but believes he still has plenty to offer. ‪”As a free agent things are not really that easy, but you can only be hopeful,” he told BBC Sport. ‪”My desire is to get back into club football and I am working hard to start playing again. ‪”Football is everything I have and I cannot just give up. I believe there’s something out there for me.” ‪Mba played for both Enugu Rangers and Warri Wolves in the Nigerian top flight before switching to French club CA Bastia in January. ‪He left for Turkish side Yeni Malatyaspor in July 2015- where he netted eight goals in 55 appearances. ‪Out of the spotlight and keen on a return to competitive action, Mba understands the challenge that lies ahead. ‪”First you’d need the luck to find someone that believes in you and ready to give you a chance,” he said. ‪”I’ve continued to stay in shape, train daily and be physically ready for any opportunity. ‪”I still have something to give and will continue to stay mentally and physically ready.” ‪Despite playing all three matches at the 2013 Fifa Confederations Cup in Brazil, his international career stalled and he missed out on the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. ‪Mba scored twice to help his country’s B side to success at the regional West African Football Union (Wafu) Cup title in 2010. ‪He has scored three goals in 16 appearances for the three time African champions.
