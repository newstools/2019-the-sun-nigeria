Ejikeme stated this on Friday in Jos at the ongoing verification of pensioners from states in the North-Central. According to her, government has prirotised issues that have to do with pensioners in the country, adding that the situation has made them very happy with the administration. “If you talk to these pensioners, they will tell you they are very happy with the government of the day, because it has made the prompt payment of their benefits a priority. “Government is interested and committed to the welfare of the pensioners; it is a first line charge from the President. “Once there is available fund, government does not delay in paying the entitlements of the pensioners and it will continue to take proper care of them until God calls them home,” she said. The executive secretary assured pensioners being owed that all their arrears would be paid once funds were available.
