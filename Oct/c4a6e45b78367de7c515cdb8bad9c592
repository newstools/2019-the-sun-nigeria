Nigeria cannot work because it is flawed. It is a fundamentally flawed system of government. “Nigeria’s government is unaccountable and unaccountable systems ultimately fail. A system in which leaders are under no pressure to account to those that they govern is a flawed system of government. The Nigerian system of government is exactly such a system,” he lamented.
