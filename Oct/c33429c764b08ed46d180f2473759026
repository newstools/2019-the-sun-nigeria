An  extremely hot porridge being transported in a tricycle in Bauchi has claimed the lives of three children, aged between nine months and nine years. The porridge  was transported in a jumbo-size plastic flask when the tricycle plunged into a pothole and upturned, emptying its contents on its  occupants who suffered severe burns and later died. A relation of the victims, Malam Auwal Bala  said, yesterday, that  the tragedy occurred on Wednesday while the family was celebrating the marriage of a member. “Three women and six children were inside the tricycle conveying the porridge, known as ‘gwate’ in local parlance, to the venue of the celebration “The flask containing the porridge was placed inside the tricycle at  the top rear and when the tricycle plunged into a large pothole, it summersaulted and the extremely hot content of the flask poured on the children on their heads, shoulders and chests “Three of the children, namely  Aniya Yahaya, six years; Mariam Mohammed, nine years and Ibrahim Yusuf, nine months, died from serious burns, while a fourth child, Khadijah Usman, aged seven, is currently in critical condition”, said Bala. He said one of the women also sustained injuries, while the  remaining two children and two women escaped unhurt.
