Super Eagles  and  Brighton and Hove Albion defender Leon Balogun is far from happy after seeing Sadio Mane’s equaliser for Liverpool against Manchester United ruled out for handball. A late effort from Adam Lallana rescued a point for Jurgen Klopp’s men as they settled for a 1-1 draw in Sunday’s Premier League fixture. It was an eventful first-half at Old Trafford with both teams finding the back of the net but the VAR took centre stage after allowing a goal and disallowing the other. After consulting the VAR, Marcus Rashford’s opener in the 36th minute was allowed to stand by referee Martin Atkinson in the intriguing encounter despite what appeared to be a foul in the buildup. A few minutes later, Mane scored the equaliser for Liverpool but it was chalked off for handball after the technology review. In his reaction to the judgement, Balogun made a case for the Senegal international and why his goal should have stood. “How’s that a handball?? Seriously??? Bounces off his thigh against his hand, which is nowhere near an unnatural position, especially if you consider that he has to “fight” the defender off,” Balogun tweeted.
