A delegation of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria(PFN), led by its President, Dr Felix Omobude, on Friday visited Vice President Yemi Osinbajo at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Omobude, who spoke with State House correspondents afterward, said the fellowship was solidly behind the vice president. The PFN president said it was a family visit as the vice president was one of PFN’s constituents. He said that Osinbajo loved Nigeria and was passionate about the country, which he always displayed in the discharge of his duties. Omobude said that the vice president always identified with PFN in its conferences and programmes; hence it was important the fellowship appreciated what he was doing for the nation and for the church. The PFN President also said that the church supported the government in its right polices and criticised it when went wrong. “The vice president loves God and there’s no doubt about that and he loves Nigeria; he passionately displays this in his services, and we are praying for him.” He said: “We know it is not easy; we are solidly behind him; the church continues to stand with the government when the policies are right. The church speaks against what it considers inappropriate; the church speaks as a voice for the very many voiceless that cannot come to a place like this.
