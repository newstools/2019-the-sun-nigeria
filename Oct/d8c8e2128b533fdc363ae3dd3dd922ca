NTEM KRIS/ ISONG CYRIL  Today is a very memorable and iconic day for a beautiful woman, an epitome of beauty inwardly and outwardly, a virtuous woman, a wonderful wife, a great mother and a very gifted Doctor. We/they call her *THE QUEEN OF HEALTH CRS* This day comes only but once in a year that’s why such days remain outstanding and very memorable to most of us especially when it concerns you Ma.  Dr Beta Edu is one of those medical professionals who have contributed immensely to the growth and well-being of Cross Riverians and other environs. She has touched the lives of millions of Nigerians medically, financially, morally, socially, academically and otherwise. She has transformed the CRSPHCDA from nothing to something recording and achieving landslide awards/victories, she achieved a lot within a space of 4yrs as her achievements and legacies remain outstanding and conspicuous for all to see. She has won so many awards as a result of her diligent performance and extravagant sacrifices to safe lives and to make mankind feel the essence of life. She even risked her life on several occasions trying to access sick Cross Riverians in interior and hard to reach villages/hamlets.  She sacrificed her all,  her happiness, her comfort, her happy moments with her kids and loved ones, her personal rest and many other relishing activities to ensure that mankind gets the necessary medical attention deserved. She has transformed many Primary Health Centers that has been written off into one of the best in the State today, she’s recuperated many lives and has given hope to those who have lost it all completely. *THE QUEEN OF HEALTH* has left a standard no one can beat even in the next 20yrs as far as CRSPHCDA is concerned.  She’s a wonderful lady, charismatic in nature, real and natural, as active as quicksilver, as humble as a dove, as immaculate as an angel.
