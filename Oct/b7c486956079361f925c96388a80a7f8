The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has relocated the Local Education Authority Primary School, Wuye to Wuse, Zone 6. The Wuye school was under the supervision of the Universal Basic Education Board while Wuse is under the Local Education Authority. The Director of the Board, Dr Adamu Noma, made this known in a statement by Malam Kabiru Musa, Assistance Director of information, FCT, Education Secretariat, on Friday in Abuja. Noma said that the measure would ensure the 2019 and 2020 new academic session of the local education authority primary school was not disrupted due to the urgency to move from its present location. He explained that the school had been operating in a temporary structure of the Federal Government Boys College, Apo and the College decided to take ownership of its facilities. He said this action made it imperative for FCTA to quickly relocate the pupils without disrupting their ongoing academic session. Noma said the new site, which was a temporary site, already had existing eight blocks of classrooms with offices and toilet facilities. According to him, the pupils have now been properly settled and classes have commenced. He stated that the daily process of movement had been smooth as there was adequate provision of school bus to and from the Wuye site to the new site for the pupils. He said that the board had been shown a permanent site within Wuye and as soon as the formal process was completed for handover, development of the site would start. Noma said the free school buses had been dedicated to the routes for the pupils by FCT Scholarship Board under the Education Secretariat. He, therefore, urged the parents and guardians to cooperate with the administration to ensure nothing hinders the pupilsâ€™ early resumption. (NAN)
