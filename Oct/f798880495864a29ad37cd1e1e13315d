She disclosed this while presenting the 2020 budget estimates of N44.21 billion for approval by the House Committee on Internally Displaced Persons and Refugees chaired by Mohammed Jega on Monday.

The minister assured that the new ministry would strengthen the coordination of humanitarian and disaster management efforts by government and other stakeholders. A breakdown of the proposed 2020 budget for National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons include N474,306,285 for personnel, N165 million for resettlement of IDPs in the North East and Bakkasi returnees in the 2020 budget proposal.
