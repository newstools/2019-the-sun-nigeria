Lukman Olabiyi Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, (SERAP) has urged Chief Justice of Nigeria and Chairman, National Judicial Council (NJC), Justice Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad to urgently develop measures and issue directives to all courts to respond to the disturbing trends by state governments and federal government to use the court as a tool to suppress citizens’ human rights.” SERAP, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) made the request in an open letter dated October 4 2019 and signed by the group Deputy Director, Kolawole Oluwadare, stated that the NJC ought to push back and act as protector of individuals’ rights against abuses by the authorities. “Across the country, state governors and federal government are charging citizens, mostly journalists, bloggers and activists, with serious crimes such as ‘treason’, ‘treasonable felony’ or bogus crime of ‘insulting public officials’, simply for exercising their human rights. “These charges, refusal of bail and granting of bail on stringent conditions seem to be dangerous manipulation of judicial authority and functions by high-ranking politicians, something which the NJC and the judiciary under your watch should resist. “In the climate of a growing clampdown on human rights of journalists and activists by several state governments and federal government, the NJC ought to push back and act as protector of individuals’ rights against abuses by the authorities. We believe that the courts, not the state government or federal government, should have the final say in matters of citizens’ human rights.”
