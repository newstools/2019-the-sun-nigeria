First, let’s take permission from Klint Da Drunk, who at a comedy show described a woman’s pubic region as her local government area (LGA). We just wonder why some women love to expose their LGA to risk of “attack” rather protect it from “insurgents.” The fashion culprits on trial today did exactly that and were arrested and arraigned in court, for opening another battlefront for soldiers fighting Boko Haram. Should the Chief of Army Staff also hire marabouts to protect women’s LGA from “insurgents” in tight jeans and suede shoes?
