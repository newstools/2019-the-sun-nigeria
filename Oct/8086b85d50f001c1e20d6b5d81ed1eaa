Rose Ejembi, Makurdi The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Makurdi zonal office, has arraigned one Mr Akintunde Ogunrinde (aka “Kekere”) for allegedly defrauding his victim of the sum of N800,000. Mr Ogunrinde, who was arraigned on Tuesday on a one-count charge for intent to defraud, is alleged to have used a UBA ATM card belonging to one Ademola Adewuyi to obtain the sum of N800,000 from a UBA ATM machine. The accused was arraigned before Justice Mobolaji Olajuwon sitting at the Federal High Court, Makurdi, Benue State, after the office of the EFCC zonal head received a petition from a complainant against Mr Ogunrinde.

When the charge was read to him, the accused pleaded “not guilty”. The prosecution counsel, G G Chia-Yakua, asked for a trial date and urged the court to remand the accused in prison custody. The accused’s counsel, I M Mari, however, made an oral application for bail on liberal terms, to which the prosecution counsel raised an objection.
