PDP Campaign Council has reacted to  Friday’s outburst of the Kaduna State governor,  El Rufai that they were coming to bury the Peoples Democratic party in Kogi State ahead of  next month’s election The PDP in a swift reaction advised the governor who is the leader of APC campaign council, to guide his “reckless and unguarded statements as it is only tenable in his Kaduna State, where anything goes without resistance” The spokesman of the council, Austin Okai said: “ We can now see why Kaduna State has been turned into the center of crime and abnormalities; the state  that enjoyed peace under the reign of Markafi and Sambo has being turned into kidnapping den and centre of religion and ethnic pogrom” The campaign council also reminded El-Rufai why he was banned from entering United States of America due to his undemocratic conduct and reckless utterances, stressing  “ in Kogi state we don’t celebrate burial or carrying of coffin, just as his body bag utterances against international observers; we wish to remind El-Rufai that  Kogi State will not tolerate any careless conduct from outside or within the state as the citizens have resolved to vote and defend their votes on 16 November.” The party said it is only when something is dead  that  burial can take place saying the PDP was much alive in Kogi and prepared to wrestle power from the ruling partystating that it was indeed APC that was dead and waiting for burial. PDP said it is not unaware of the El-Rufai’s rigging strategy that foisted him on the people of Kaduna State which he intends to use Kogi with the combined  use of force and armed thugs to instill fear on the people of the state to give APC a leeway to rig the forthcoming election. He said even though Kaduna State governor won the last election through all means possible, he is still being challenged in court because of of the obvious lapses and flaws that characterised the governorship election. “ We intend to teach you a bitter lesson in Kogi by November election, considering the fact that your candidate in APC, Yahaya Bello is not sellable, moreover, he could not account for billions of naira that accrued to the state in the last three and half years. “A governor whose mandate is being challenged  in court, you have no moral right to influence the political decision of Kogites in the next election, so implore  him to mind his business” the statement added.
