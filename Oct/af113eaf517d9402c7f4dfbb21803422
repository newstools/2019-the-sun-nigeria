On getting wind of the meeting, the cult gang, which allegedly camped at the Apostolic Church in Okundi, close to Boki Boys’ Secondary School, struck, killing their first victim, identified as Bukie Bankong. Bankong was said to have vehemently spoken against cultism in the community. In what appeared as a reprisal attack, the entire community reportedly rose and attacked cult members, killing some of their members including Alphonsus Etta Ewung, Otu Agbor Edum, Joseph Bukie Bankong, Chief Paulinus Out’s son, amongst others. Since the outbreak of the clash, several houses and property worth millions of naira have been reportedly burnt. State Commissioner of Police Austine Agbonlahor confirmed the violent clash, adding that the police had been mobilised to the community to maintain peace.
