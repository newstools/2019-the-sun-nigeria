Some members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) indicated interests in the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Tuesday when David Lyon, the APC governorship candidate in Bayelsa, took campaign to Sagbama Local Government Area of the state. The campaign is preparatory to the state governorship election on Nov. 16. Lyon said that APC had convinced the politicians that decamped that the people were tired of PDP style of administration of the state and needed a positive change. The APC governorship candidate noted that the people lacked good road network, health facilities, schools and proper drainage systems in the entire state. He said that when voted into power, the APC administration would bring development, security and investors to the state. “Apart from these, youth empowerment schemes would be introduced while older people and the vulnerable would also be carried along,” he promised. The APC Campaign Coordinator for Sagbama, Mr Micheal Kurlorkor, said that the crowd were the indigenes of the area. In a welcome address, Bayelsa APC Chairman Jothan Amos promised the people that decamped of all inclusiveness during and after the election. The former Acting-Governor and former Speaker of the Bayelsa Assembly, Mr Nestor Binabo, said that Sagbama people were ready to support the APC candidate. He described the APC candidate as the chosen one to take Bayelsa to the next level.(NAN)
