Godwin Tsa, Abuja The Governorship Election Petition Tribunal in Sokoto State will deliver judgment in the petition filed by Ahmed Aliyu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) challenging the declaration of Aminu Tambuwal as winner in Abuja, today. Parties to the petition had  adopted their final addresses for and against the petition on September 3. Counsel to one of the parties, Hassan Liman (SAN) told Daily Sun that hearing notice had been issued by the tribunal, but could not explain why Justice Abbas Bawale-led tribunal is opting to deliver judgment in Abuja.
