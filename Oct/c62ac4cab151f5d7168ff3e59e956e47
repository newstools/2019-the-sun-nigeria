A market expert who craved for anonymity said that the market is suffering from the weak state of the economy while adding that there is obviously nothing driving investors towards equities.“Judging by how the stock market closed this week, investors are not focusing on equities rather they have shifted their focus to fixed income instruments which is more like a safe haven to them now. “As far as I am concerned, there has not been any positive trigger to make investors look at our market because our economy is not growing at the rate it is supposed to, so I still foresee the bears trending at least at the start of the new trading week, but bargain opportunities still exist for investors who want to rebalance their portfolios”, she said. For Cordros Capital, the trend witnessed through the year is likely to persist through the final quarter of the year. “We expect pockets of gains over the final months of the year as fund and portfolio managers realign portfolios prior to the start of 2020. Nonetheless, we note that valuations remain attractive driven by price deterioration throughout the year. Hence, we advise that long-term investors consider appropriately timed investments”, they said.
