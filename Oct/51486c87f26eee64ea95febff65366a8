Proprietress of the school, Omolara Adedugbe, described it as M.D Nursery and Primary School’s way of giving back to the society. Adedugbe said: “We won’t stop giving back to the society. This is just one of the ways in which we show our gratitude to the communities in which we operate. We also do yearly visits to public primary schools around us, where we do a project for the benefit of the pupils and also visit the less privileged in homes close to us.”
