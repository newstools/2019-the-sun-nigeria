Her words: “My passion for kids learning really kicked into high gear when I started helping my younger son, a typical digital native, with his schoolwork and learning needs. I quickly noticed he could play games on any phone or tablet but wasn’t interested in learning when it came to schoolwork and conventional learning,”
