The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has deployed 1,750 corps members to Gombe State for
the 2019 batch ‘C’ stream I orientation course. The scheme’s Public Relations Officer in the state, Margaret Dakama, made this known in a statement on Wednesday in Gombe. She stated that documentation and registration of prospective corps members for the three weeks orientation programme
would commence on Tuesday, Nov. 5 to midnight of Wednesday Nov. 6. She noted that “prospective corps members are therefore expected to report to Amada temporary orientation camp kilometre
21, Gombe-Bauchi highway on time before the registration portal closes.” She also stated that the management of the scheme had observed growing trend of change in the NYSC uniform and improper dressing by corps members. She added that “in view of that, prospective corps members are advised not to deface their uniform either by slim fitting, use of rubber bands
or cutting it to three quarter. “Members must be ready to be dressed properly for all occasions and functions, as leaders of tomorrow and role models to millions of
youths in the country.” She solicited the support and cooperation of stakeholders for successful and hitch-free orientation. (NAN)
