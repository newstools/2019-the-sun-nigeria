Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja The Presidency has urged Nigerians to ignore gossips and some support groups staging street demonstrations asking President Muhammadu Buhari to do a third term. Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, in a statement said Buhari will restrict himself to the two-term limit on holding office as President, adding that he will also not seek to amend the constitution to suit this purpose. The statement read: “The Presidency wishes to correct internet-based gossip and un-informed media commentary regarding presidential term limits, given credence by so-called support groups, staging street demonstrations asking President Muhammadu Buhari to do a third term. “There are no circumstances – nor set of circumstances – under which President Buhari may seek to amend the Constitution regarding the two-term term limit on holding office as President. “President Buhari intends to serve his full second elected term in office, ending 2023 – and then there shall be a general election in which he will not be a candidate. “There is not even the faintest possibility that this will change. “It is important to note that there was a past attempt to change the Constitution to allow for the-then incumbent president to stand for a third term. That attempt was wrong, unconstitutional – and rightly rebuffed. No such attempt will happen under this President. “President Buhari is a democrat. He respects the Constitution. Any activity aimed at altering the two-term limit will not succeed and shall never have his time nor support.”
