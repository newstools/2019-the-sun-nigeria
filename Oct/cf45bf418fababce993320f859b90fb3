The victim is a pupil in one of the private primary schools in Asaba, the state capital.  Onyeje was found guilty of the one-count charged of unnatural/sodomy preferred against him by the prosecution.  The presiding judge, Justice Ngozi Azinge who handed down the sentence declined plea for alocutus by counsel to the defendant.  Justice Azinge described the act as barbaric, despicable and abominable, adding that persons who engage in such acts do not deserve mercy.  “People like you should be locked away from society so that you don’t go around defiling innocent children.
