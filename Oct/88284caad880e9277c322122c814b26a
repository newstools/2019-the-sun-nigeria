Akpan, during the review of the company’s business performance for the year under review, attributed the successes to team work and determination of workers, to change the age-long premium narrative, review marketing strategy by the new management, injection of fresh ideas and added efforts by the new hands that joined the system. While assuring that 2019 would be more fruitful considering the achievements so far recorded, he called for all hands to be on deck to realize the recapitalization of the company for big ticket businesses.
