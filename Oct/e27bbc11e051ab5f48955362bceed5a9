Gyang Bere, Jos Deputy National Chairman of Christians Association of Nigeria (CAN) and President of a conglomeration of 15 denominational churches in Nigeria under the umbrella of TEKAN, Rev. Caleb Ahima, has said it is dangerous for Christians to be divided with the insecurity ravaging the country. Rev. Ahima disclosed this in Jos during the foundation-laying ceremony of the Administrative block of TCNN Staff Secondary School, Jos, Plateau State. “It is dangerous for Christians in the country to be divided coupled with the high level of insecurity in the country. We must resist further attempt to divide us,  but standing together and this will bring development. “Christians in Nigeria are divided and we must collectively resist any attempt to further divide us. We must also stand firm despite the security and political challenges. “We must promote the unity of Nigeria against the background of insecurity, kidnapping and other challenges, because it is together we can achieve more than individuals; our God who is God of unity will help us to be united and always stand in one voice.” He said that CAN will continue to champion what will unite the church in love to enable us remain firm and focus in what will promote peace in the country. Rev. Ahima commended the Managing Director of the La-Shipson Construction Nigeria Ltd Hon. Moses Godia Shipi for sponsoring the project for the benefit of the church.
