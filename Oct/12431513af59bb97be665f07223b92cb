Head of Trading at CCI Traders, Uche Paragon, explains that “this is going to lift so many barriers and restrictions we are facing with international communities, and we can now be more recognized as one of the global trading companies. “We are also working hard to be incorporated in many EU zones including UK, so traders from the West African region can enjoy same trading experience with others.” The acquisition is the first of its kind from the record so far, as CCITraders becomes the first Nigerian company to acquire such a licence in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
