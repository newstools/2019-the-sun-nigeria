Magnus Eze, Enugu The International Society for Civil Liberties and Rule of Law, (Intersociety), has petitioned Benue State Governor, Dr. Samuel Ortom and the state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Garba Mukaddas, over alleged widespread and coordinated attacks and threats of annihilation against Igbo people resident in the State. The letter, dated October 2, 2019 which has since been dispatched to them, was signed by Head of Civil Liberties and Rule of Law, Obianuju Igboeli, Head of Democracy and Good Governance, Chinwe Umeche; Head of Campaign and Publicity; Chidimma Udegbunam, and Board Chair of Intersociety, Emeka Umeagbalasi. It was copied to the Secretary General of Amnesty International, UK; the group’s Country Director in Nigeria as well as Executive Director of Human Rights Watch, USA. Several others who received copies of the letter for their necessary interventions include; Chairman, South East Governors’ Forum, Chief David Umahi, President General, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Nnia Nwodo, President, Ala-Igbo Development Foundation (ADF); Prof. Uzodinma Nwala, President, Association of South East Town Unions (ASETU), Chief Emeka Diwe, to mention but a few. The rights group also drew attention to the plight of the ancestral Igbo communities in the state, noting that they were facing acute government neglect and threats of annihilation in the hands of jihadist Fulani herdsmen and their splinter “bandits”. According to Intersociety, the Igbo people in Benue are majorly settled in Ado, Oju, Obi and Okpoku Local Government Areas of the State while the resident Igbo population under coordinated ‘indigenized’ attacks including abduction-for-ransom and other sundry extortions at gunpoint; armed robbery, torture and killing in captivity or threats of same are largely found in Gboko, Adikpo-Kwande, Ukum, Zaki-Biam and Katsina-Ala Local Government Areas of the State. The leaders of the two Igbo populations had further disclosed that the kidnap-for-ransom and targeted armed robbery were majorly perpetrated by the indigenes of Benue State including notorious political thugs, local gangs and other criminal elements who double as kidnappers. “As a matter of fact, the two sets of defenceless Igbo populations are presently facing serious of threats of annihilation and total ruination of their legitimate businesses, to the extent that scores have already fled and left the State or relocated to friendly business environments within and outside the country. Others have also gone missing till date,” the group alleged. The concerned Igbo Union in Benue had on 2nd September, 2019 cried out through the trio of Mr. Okafor Nnolim, Mr. Ndukaku and Mr. Ikem Ani during which they alleged ‘abduction of not less than 50 persons in the State since February 2017”. Again, on 30th September, 2019, they held a follow-up press briefing in Enugu, disclosing further that ‘three prominent Igbo citizens in the State and not less than N277m had been lost to kidnappers’. According to their Public Relations Officer, the N277m ($900,000) was spent in freeing 48 kidnapped Igbo business men and women. While giving a breakdown of huge financial losses so far incurred by the Igbo community in Benue State, especially in Gboko, Adikpo-Kwande, Ukum, Zaki-Biam and Katsina-Ala LGAs of the State, Ezeadi disclosed that some of the victims were murdered even after the demanded ransom had been paid.
