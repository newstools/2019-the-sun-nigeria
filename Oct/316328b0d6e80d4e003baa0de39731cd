Samuel Bello, Abuja The Minister of State for Mines and Steel Development, Uchechukwu Ogah, has said that Nigeria is at a vantage position to become one of the world’s top industrial hubs.

And they are all needed for the fourth revolution. I can assure you that Nigeria will become not only the giant of Africa but of the world,” he posited.
