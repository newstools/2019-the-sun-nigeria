West Brom defender, Semi Ajayi, has disclosed that last Sundayâ€™s grade A international friendly match between Nigeria and Brazil will boost his confidence while on club duty. Nigeria played out a 1-1 draw with Brazil at the National Stadium in Singapore and Ajayi said the experience he gained from the game will help his Premier League promotion-chasing club. The Albion centre back saw every single minute of the game against the Selecao and was impressive as Neymar, Coutinho and Firmino were limited to a few chances and a single breach of the Super Eagles net, to earn the three time African champions their first positive results against the South Americans.
