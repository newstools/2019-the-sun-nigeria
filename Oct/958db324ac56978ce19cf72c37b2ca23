Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja The Federal government is on the verge of reintroducing toll plazas on roads across the country. The tolls were scrapped in 2004 by the Olusegun Obasanjo. The Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, disclosed this while briefing State House correspondents alongside Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, at the end of Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting chaired by President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. He explained that the Federal government was working on modalities for reintroducing cashless toll plaza, noting that there was no law against toll plazas in the country. Fashola added that other logistics being worked out before the reintroduction included acquiring more lands that would provide up to ten lanes plazas. Fashola said: “Where are we in PPP and toll gate? Let me just clarify this impression about toll gates. There is no reason why we cannot toll; there is no reason. There was a policy of government to abolish tolls or as it were, dismantle toll plazas but there is no law that prohibits tolling in Nigeria today. “We expect to return toll plazas; we have concluded designs of what they will look like, what material they will be rebuilt with, what new considerations must go into them. What we are looking out now and trying to conclude is how the bank end runs. And that is important because we want to limit significantly if not totally eliminate cash at the plazas while ensuring that electronic devices that are being used do not impede rapid movement. “We are also now faced with the need to acquire more land to establish the width of the toll plazas because I believe we are looking at ten-lane plazas so that there can be more outlets. So we need to acquire more land; that is the work that is currently being done now. “But let me also say that the expectation that collection of tolls will then produce the replacement cost of the road is perhaps not accurate because of the traffic toll count that we have done on major highways does not suggest that there is enough vehicular traffic across all roads. “The two or three heavy routes are the Lagos-Ibadan, Abuja-Kano, Abuja-Lokoja. Now, Lagos-Ibadan the heaviest traffic you will find is between Lagos and Shagamu, it is about 40,000 vehicles. After Shagamu, heading to Ibadan it drops to about 20,000. So, most of it has gone eastward going towards Ondo and Ore and by the time you get Benin, the number significantly drops. “It goes up again at the confluence where they are heading towards the Niger. So, you can see that it is not a static 50,000 all the way. Same thing with Abuja-Kano- Zaria. After Kaduna, the traffic significantly drops. It is about 40,000 there too but after Kaduna it begins to drop by the time you get to Zaria. If you have driven on that road before, by the time you are driving between Zaria and Kaduna you see how thin the recurring number of vehicles you meet is and as you begin to head between Kaduna and Abuja, the number of vehicles begin to increase.  “So I think it is important to have that at the back of your mind, not all roads have those traffic counts. “I also want to let you know that what we are doing is not accidental; we are being deliberate and methodical. So, we are collecting information to know what to do with, which place and what. “Going to PPP, I say that in the context of people arrogating PPPs the right to toll, no, government can also toll. That is the point and that will happen without taking private sector fund. “Let me refer you back to the Executive Order Seven that the president signed on tax credit for infrastructure. Essentially that is another PPP initiative where companies are supposed to invest their money in infrastructure and then recover it back from their tax payments. “What people may not understand is first of all the companies have to make profit before it can be taxed. So, when you have to build a N50 billion highway, how many Nigerian companies are even doing a turnover of N50 billion in the private sector? How many are declaring profits of N50 billion and the tax that you apply on N50 billion profit is 30 percent. So, if you do that, it will be about N15 billion. “Look at it that way, so how many companies are in that? A few banks maybe and perhaps Aliko Dangote and it is surprising therefore that the Dangote group are the ones who are building the Apapa-Oworonsoki expressway using tax credit.”  The Works and Housing Minister also disclosed that the council also approved additional N15.765 billion for two roads in the country. The two roads are Suleja-Minna-Lambata road and Ibadan-Lagere-Ilesa bypass. He said the two roads contracts approved on Wednesday were upwardly reviewed from the initially-approved rates. On the 101km Suleja-Minna-Lambata road, he said FEC also approved additional N12.6 billion, while additional N3.165 billion was approved for the Ibadan-Lagere-Ilesa bypass.  function insertAfter(e,t){t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t.nextSibling)}function getElementByXPath(e,t){if(!t)t=document;if(t.evaluate)return t.evaluate(e,document,null,9,null).singleNodeValue;while(e.charAt(0)=="/")e=e.substr(1);var n=t;var r=e.split("/");for(var i=0;i<r.length;i++){var a=r[i].split(/(\w*)\[(\d*)\]/gi).filter(function(e){return!(e==""||e.match(/\s/gi))},this);var l=a[0];var o=a[1]?a[1]-1:0;if(i<r.length-1)n=n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o];else return n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o]}}if(!Array.prototype.filter){Array.prototype.filter=function(e){var t=this.length>>>0;if(typeof e!="function"){throw new TypeError}var n=[];var r=arguments[1];for(var i=0;i<t;i++){if(i in this){var a=this[i];if(e.call(r,a,i,this)){n.push(a)}}}return n}}function injectWidgetByXpath(e){var t=getElementByXPath(e);if(t==null){t=document.getElementById("tbdefault")}innerInject(t)}function injectWidgetByMarker(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);innerInject(t.parentNode)}function innerInject(e){var t=document.createElement("span");var n=document.createElement("script");var r="if JS crashes here, the first innerHTML value should be enclosed with single quotes instead of double, go to the minified version and change it";t.innerHTML="<div id='taboola-below-article'></div><div id='taboola-below-article-second'></div>";n.innerHTML="window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-c', container:'taboola-below-article', placement:'below-article', target_type: 'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-d', container:'taboola-below-article-second', placement:'below-article-2nd', target_type: 'mix'});";insertAfter(t,e);insertAfter(n,t)}injectWidgetByMarker('tbmarker');
