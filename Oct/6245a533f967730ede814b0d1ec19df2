The Obasanjo Administration realized the need for the development of gas  to drive the Power sector as a way of solving the Energy problem and Adegbulugbe came to the rescue with series of policy initiatives that would have made Gas available for the power turbines which Nigeria invested billions of dollars in bringing to Nigeria.

Perhaps it needs to the echoed at this stage his strident effort to bring back to life of the then moribund Nigeria Atomic Energy Commission which he saw as a veritable source  of coordinating efforts to use nuclear  reactors  for power generation for the country.To him as a Nuclear expert, Atomic Energy also offers a good source of power inspite of fears over its  possible  negative uses. He also led the Nigerian Delegation to the International Atomic Energy Agency conference in 2006 where Nigeria was accepted back into the fold. A SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEUR- MATCHING THEORY WITH PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS A man always seeking for creative solutions to Nigeria’s challenges, Adegbulugbe was not satisfied as an academic professing theoretical solutions to the energy conundrum Nigeria found itself, so he sought for  an opportunity where his ideas on climate change and zero gas flares in the oil and gas sector could be implemented. Providence brought him an opportunity through the decision of the Federal Government to implement a pilot project of theWorld Bank propelled small scale gas utilization project, where by Green Energy International Ltd, of which he was  prime mover was granted the Operatorship of the Otakikpo field in OML 11, based in River state, to practically implement a zero gas flare field whereby all products in the value chain particularly gas  will be utilized for gas to power and Liquified Petroleum Gas( LPG) otherwise known as cooking gas.The field under 24 months was  into production of 6000 barrels of oil per day,a feat which is a record in the industry. That small asset is becoming a reference point in marginal field operations with its recently approved 1million capacity onshore terminal, 40,000 barrels per day processing facility and 20km export pipeline, among other projects .
