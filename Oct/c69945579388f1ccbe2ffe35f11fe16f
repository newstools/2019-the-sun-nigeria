As my country marks another year of independence I say a prayer of hope As I flip through newspapers, switch channels and read one WhatsApp post after the other Almost all bearing tales of woe and gloom I say a prayer for peace As normal activities every where else become abnormal in my country As every single day unveils the talents of yet another drama King or Queen All of them unrelenting in their capacity to confound, confuse and amuse I say a prayer for sobriety and clarity As our founding fathers and mothers roll in their graves Shuddering in disappointment and boiling with anger I say a prayer for wisdom As my country celebrates another year of freedom from colonial masters And as local masters go to war with their local fiefdoms I say a prayer for moderation As our prayer houses and spaces grow exponentially And our men and women of God employ bodyguards Yet cover their flock with the blood of Jesus, I pray that God will never turn his face from us. As our rains get heavier, and the floods keep coming I pray that it is only our sins that are washed away and not our children, homes and farms As one more year passes by And our leaders gather to recite all the right things in all the right places I pray for the will to right all wrongs and the courage to save this great nation from chaos As we celebrate another year of freedom I pray for a spirit of humility I pray for the willingness to reflect I pray for understanding That we might know there are things we cannot dance our way out of There are examinations in life that need to be taken and graded And there are things that can not be fixed by fixers I pray for good health to all I pray for prosperity I pray for the success of our children And I pray that we are all here when the next year rolls by.
