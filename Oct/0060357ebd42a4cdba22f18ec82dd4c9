The Comptroller General of the Nigeria Correctional Service, Jafar Ahmed, who confirmed this while speaking with journalists in Koton Kafe on Monday said that the flood came at about 3 a.m., submerging the perimeter fence and the walls of two cells.

He said that details of the incident will be made public later. Also speaking, the Security Adviser to the state governor, Jerry Omadara, confirmed that over 100 of the inmates had been re-arrested. According to him, some of the inmates returned on their own, some reported themselves at nearby police stations while a combined team of policemen, army, navy and civil defence corps arrested others. Omodara said that the state government was informed of the incident at about 4 a.m., adding that Governor Yahaya Bello immediately directed the head of security agencies in the state to deploy their personnel to the scene. He said that security agents were still combing the bush to re-arrest some of the fleeing inmates, saying that the flood was not making it easy for them to escape.
