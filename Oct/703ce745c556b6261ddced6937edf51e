 “They were coming from Enugu, the police sergeant was on escort with the principal. They ran into an ambush of armed robbers. He came out against them but unfortunately he lost his life” the Commissioner said, adding ‎that the case is under investigation and a formal report has been made to the Edo State command on the incident. “We are investigating, as I am talking to you I just sent a combined team of police officers into the bush now. On that day, they followed them and they abandoned their car and a lot of things were recovered from the car. “So, I told them to smoke the forest. They used long range tear gas. When they saw our police they entered into the bush but they didn’t know the road and immediately they reach a dead end, they abandoned the car there. Our men went there yesterday but I sent them back today again because there is the posibility that they will come out because wherever criminals operated and succeeded there is almost one hundred percent possibility that they will come back,” he said. It was learnt that the incident occurred around 3 pm on Tuesday at the Benin Bypass while Igoche with force number F/462248 was escorting his principal to Lagos. The gunmen who were said to have come out of surrounding bushes, reportedly rained bullets on the Lexus GX470 Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) conveying Igoche and the school principal. Recall that the police and the Edo State government recently cleared bushes by the road side of Lagos Benin highway to give clear visibility to motorists following the spate of kidnapping and attacks on the highway. But following the killing of the Police Sergeant, the matter was yesterday raised at the state House of Assembly in a motion of urgent national importance by the Deputy Speaker, Mr. Yekini Idiaye. Consequently, security was beefed up in the area with road check points mounted by the police, soldiers and vigilante group.
