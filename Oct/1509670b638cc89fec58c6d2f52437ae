The statement commended the police for their proactive investigation as well as the synergy among the security agencies that led to the recovery of the victims of the crime. They expressed gratitude to the state governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje; the Emir of Kano, Mallam Muhammad Sanusi and the people of the state for their understanding of the issue. They urged Igbo people in the state to be law-abiding and to go about their legitimate business. Checks conducted in the state by our correspondent indicated that the abduction of the minors had elicited outrage. Meanwhile, Kano State Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, has promised to see that justice is done on the matter, saying that all legal instruments available to his administration would be employed to address the situation squarely. He assured that the arrested kidnappers, along with their accomplices would be prosecuted in court. “Kidnapping is seriously abhorred and condemned. What is more worrisome is the age of the victims – kids for that matter. My administration, Kano people and any right-thinking individual or group of individuals, condemn this from all standpoints,” he stated. He stressed that the protection of human rights, irrespective of age, ethnicity, religious or political affiliations, is the responsibility of any serious government. “Government will invite the parents of those rescued from the alleged kidnappers for further discussion and relationship. At the same time, we are seriously working with security agencies to unearth similar cases. No stone will be unturned,” he promised. He revealed that a powerful committee was in the pipeline to see to the root cause of the matter, find lasting solution to it and similar criminal activities as well as avert a future re-occurrence. He commended the security agencies for the role they played in rescuing the children, while calling on the members of the public to continue to cooperate with the security agencies so as to have safer and more peaceful Kano. He asked parents to always be extra vigilant on the movement of their children. “We all know that it is Allah who protects all, but we as human beings, must stand up and be very cautious and then pray.”  function insertAfter(e,t){t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t.nextSibling)}function getElementByXPath(e,t){if(!t)t=document;if(t.evaluate)return t.evaluate(e,document,null,9,null).singleNodeValue;while(e.charAt(0)=="/")e=e.substr(1);var n=t;var r=e.split("/");for(var i=0;i<r.length;i++){var a=r[i].split(/(\w*)\[(\d*)\]/gi).filter(function(e){return!(e==""||e.match(/\s/gi))},this);var l=a[0];var o=a[1]?a[1]-1:0;if(i<r.length-1)n=n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o];else return n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o]}}if(!Array.prototype.filter){Array.prototype.filter=function(e){var t=this.length>>>0;if(typeof e!="function"){throw new TypeError}var n=[];var r=arguments[1];for(var i=0;i<t;i++){if(i in this){var a=this[i];if(e.call(r,a,i,this)){n.push(a)}}}return n}}function injectWidgetByXpath(e){var t=getElementByXPath(e);if(t==null){t=document.getElementById("tbdefault")}innerInject(t)}function injectWidgetByMarker(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);innerInject(t.parentNode)}function innerInject(e){var t=document.createElement("span");var n=document.createElement("script");var r="if JS crashes here, the first innerHTML value should be enclosed with single quotes instead of double, go to the minified version and change it";t.innerHTML="<div id='taboola-below-article'></div><div id='taboola-below-article-second'></div>";n.innerHTML="window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-c', container:'taboola-below-article', placement:'below-article', target_type: 'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-d', container:'taboola-below-article-second', placement:'below-article-2nd', target_type: 'mix'});";insertAfter(t,e);insertAfter(n,t)}injectWidgetByMarker('tbmarker');
