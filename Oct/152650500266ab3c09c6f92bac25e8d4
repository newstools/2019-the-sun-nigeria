Kanu said in the video: “Today, I announce the passing of my mother Ugoeze Sally Nmeme Kanu. May Chukwu Okike Abiama grant her eternal rest.” The controversial Igbo separatist leader blamed the Nigerian Army for his mother’s death, attributing it to the trauma she supposedly suffered when troops of the Operation Python Dance invaded their country home in Afaraukwu, Umuahia, Abia State, and killed Biafra activists found in the place. According to Kanu, his mother has been sacrificed in the struggle for the actualisation of Biafra.
