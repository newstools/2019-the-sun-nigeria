German Economy Minister, Peter Altmaier, took a bad fall on Tuesday as he was walking off a stage at a digital summit. The incident happened after Altmaier gave the opening speech at the government-sponsored event in the north-western city of Dortmund. A spokeswoman said he tripped on some stairs. Paramedics attended to him as he lay on the floor, shielding him from view with a black sheet. The room, where the event was taking place, was cleared of people. An ambulance took Altmaier to a hospital shortly thereafter, sources told dpa. They said he was conscious and had already thanked his doctors for the care they provided. (dpa/NAN)
