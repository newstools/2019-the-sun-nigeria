During a special prayer session which he organized in honour of Osun State governor, Gboyega Oyetola, the Oluwo said prayers for leaders is the responsibility of the led. He declared that divine instruction rather than religion or politics inspired him to pray for leaders in the country to succeed in steering the ship of  the nation to a safer destination.

Oyetola is an asset with dynamic intellect to lead Osun State to a greater height among other states of the federation. I have no doubt in my mind that he would earn second term with this steady progress,” he said. In his response, the representative of the governor, Dr. Rafiu Uzamot, expressed Governor Oyetola’s appreciation to the Oluwo for his compassionate, doggedness and unrepentant progressive leadership to the people of Iwo and its environs.
