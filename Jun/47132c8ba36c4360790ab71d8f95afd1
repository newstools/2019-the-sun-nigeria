“They packed Michael’s slippers, which were in the wheelbarrow but the young man fell on his knees and started pleading with them to release his goods.  It was at that point that two of the DOPT workers descended on him.  They pushed him around in the course of which he fell down and the DOPT driver ran over him and he died instantly.”
“At that point, pandemonium broke out as everybody took to their heels, including the DOPT men.  But some traders returned and decided to take the dead body to the DOPT office near the Governor’s Office.”
