 Kathryn Mayorga has dropped the rape lawsuit she filed against Cristiano Ronaldo in the United States. As confirmed by Bloomberg, Cristiano Ronaldo is no longer the subject of a rape allegation in Las Vegas. In September 2018, Kathryn Mayorga, now 34, claimed the Juventus player had attacked her in the penthouse of a Las Vegas hotel in 2009 when she was 25 and was paid $375,000 in hush money. She said she was forced to sign a non-disclosure agreement by Ronaldoâ€™s lawyers at the time, but reopened the case and filed charges in Las Vegas, demanding $200,000 in damages. Katheryn Mayorga has now ended her lawsuit, meaning the Juventus attacker can now draw a line under this chapter. According to Bloomberg, a notice of voluntary dismissal was reportedly filed in May in a Nevada State Court in Las Vegas, but the reasons for it are not clear at this time as the filing does not say whether a settlement was reached with the Portuguese superstar regarding the rape case.
