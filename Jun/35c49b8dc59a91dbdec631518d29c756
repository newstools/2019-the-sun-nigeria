Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri  The state Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Imo State, Dan Nwafor, has predicted that President Muhammadu Buhari might be the last president of the party if the national Chairman of the party, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole is not shown the way out. Nwafor attributed the lingering crisis in his state as well as other states to the selfish and dictatorial ways Oshiomole had allegedly conducted the party prior to the general elections. He also accused him of being the reason the party could not do well in the last election in Imo and other parts of the country. READ ALSO: Nigeria’s Muhammad-Bande elected President of 74th UNGA
