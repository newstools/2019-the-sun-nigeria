The Oman-registered vehicle was carrying 31 passengers when the crash occurred on Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Road, police said. Indian officials said that eight Indian citizens were among the dead. The driver, who is in his 50s, is receiving treatment for minor injuries and an investigation is underway.
