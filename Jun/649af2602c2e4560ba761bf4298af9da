Gyang Bere, Jos Plateau State Governor Simon Lalong  has vowed to take stringent measures towards reducing hardship in the state. Lalong disclosed this while signing into law, four bills that were passed into law by the House of Assembly. He said that the laws  which include Plateau State Specialist Hospital bill, Plateau State Contributory Health Care Management  Agency, Plateau State Energy Cooperation bill and  the Water Sector will  address health, power and water challenges in the state. The governor said that his administration would  utilise the limitless opportunities in the state to develop different sectors of the economy as well as improve on the living conditions of the people. “These  four bills that I have signed into law would  bridge the gap created by the absence of the enabling laws guiding  the operations of the relevant agencies . This will help to reduce hardship faced by the citizens of the  state  as they go about attending to their daily needs.” He  applauded members of the House of Assembly  for speedy deliberation  on the bills despite their tight schedules and preparation for winding down the 8th Assembly.
