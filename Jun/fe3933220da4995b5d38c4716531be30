(Reuters) London Mayor Sadiq Khan said on Tuesday that Donald Trump was a poster boy for far-right activists all over the world, continuing a long-running spat with the U.S. President. “Surely we should be saying ‘listen, you know, you do realise you’re a poster-boy for the far-right movement around the world,” he told Sky News in an interview, citing Trump’s policies on Muslims and immigration centres.
