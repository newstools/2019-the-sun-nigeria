President, Gianni Infantino was re-elected to office at the body’s 69th Congress in Paris, France yesterday. He was re-elected by acclamation by FIFA’s 211 member associations, as he was the only candidate for the position. First elected at an extraordinary congress in February 2016, following a meltdown that consumed Sepp Blatter, FIFA’s ninth president will now start his first full four-year term. “In just over three years, this organization went from being toxic, almost criminal, to being what it should be: an institution that develops football,” Infantino said after his re-election.
