Although we belong to different arms of government, we are all accountable to this dear state. The executive arm of government will enhance a harmonious relationship with the other two arms as has always been done. We will not only uphold this tradition, we will raise the bar because no arm of government can survive without the other. The journey of four years has started and now is the time to put all hands on deck.
“I signed into law the Appropriation bill and three other bills passed by the Assembly. In the coming days, I will be seeking your cooperation to Pay Pass bills that will be sent to you from time to time for the development and progress of the state,” Sanwo-Olu said.
