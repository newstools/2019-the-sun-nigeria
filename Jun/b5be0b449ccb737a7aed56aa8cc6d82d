Obinna Odogwu, Abakaliki  No fewer than three persons have been killed in a cult war between two rival cult groups in Ezza North and South local government areas of Ebonyi State in the last two days. The first incident which took place on Sunday was in Onueke Park in Ezza South where one person was short dead while a rival group on Monday stormed Ezza North and gunned down two persons down. This came few weeks after the state government threatened to publish the names of suspected cultists in the state. One of the victims of the killing, Mr Ifeanyi (surname withheld), was said to be a staff of Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki (AE-FUTHA).
