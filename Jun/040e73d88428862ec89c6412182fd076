Onyedinma Dilichukwu, former Chairperson, Nigerian Women’s Professional Football League (NWPFL), has urged the Super Falcons to play as a team to achieve results at the ongoing World Cup in France. Dilichukwu gave the advice on Sunday in Lagos following a disappointing 0-3 loss to Norway in their opening match on Saturday. She told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the Super Falcons started well but lost concentration as the match progressed. “The players played individualistic game when they should have been playing as a team. “They need to get their acts together; their strength lies in their collective effort, when they can harness this they will get the desired result,” she said. The former Sports Director of FCT told NAN that the team’s defeat should not in any way rattle their confidence in subsequent matches.

NAN reports that Super Falcons will play against South Korea on June 12, while the final group stage match will be against France on June 17. (NAN)
