China is preparing to curb some technology exports to the United States, the chief editor of China’s Global Times newspaper said on Saturday. “If enacted, the measures suggest Beijing would retaliate over U.S. restrictions imposed on Shenzhen-based Huawei Technologies Co Ltd due to what Washington said were national security issues. “China is building a management mechanism to protect China’s key technologies,’’ the pro-CCP paper’s editor-in-chief,  Hu Xijin, said in a tweet. According to Xijin, this is a major step to improve its system and also a move to counter U.S. crackdown. “Once taking effect, some technology exports to the U.S. will be subject to control,’’ he added. Hu however did not cite any named sources in his tweet. The Global times are not an official mouthpiece for the Communist Party,  though its views are believed to at times represent those of its leaders. Around the time of Xijin’s  tweet, Chinese state media outlet Xinhua reported that the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) would organise a study to establish a “national technological security management list system.’’ READ ALSO: Violence rages in Syria’s truce zone These announcements came weeks after Washington placed Chinese network equipment maker and smartphone vendor ,Huawei , on a blacklist that effectively bars U.S. companies from supplying it with goods and services.
