Abraham Ingobere (Brass constituency 3), retained his position as deputy speaker while Monday Obolo Bubou (Southern Ijaw constituency 3) was elected House leader. Isenah’s emergence with a unanimous votes from all members has further shown the dominance of Dickson and his Restoration Team in the affairs of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the state.
