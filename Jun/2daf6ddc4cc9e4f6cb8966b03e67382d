Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri The immediate past governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorochaâ€™s worry is far from over as gunmen, suspected to be hired assassins on Friday night, allegedly invaded his country home in Ogboko, Ideato South Council Area of Imo State barely a few hours after his rumoured arrest by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The ex-governor and his family members were said not to be in the mansion when the gunmen broke; it was only some of his security details that were around at the moment.
