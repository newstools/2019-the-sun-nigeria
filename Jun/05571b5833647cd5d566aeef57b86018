On GOtv, the matches would be available to subscribers on GOtv Max and GOtv Plus packages.

Now, we are excited to announce that we will bring it back as part of the commentary for the 2019 African Cup of Nations, as we believe it will help Nigerians have more connection to the competition’s broadcast.”
