Alhaji Atiku will be president of Nigeria this year via the presidential election matter currently going on in the tribunal.” and to assure you that he will emerge victorious and be declared winner, I will resign my traditional medicine practice if what I am saying fails. “I will make it known to the world through the electronic and print media that I have resigned if this prophecy fails to stand. “I said it before the election that Atiku will be president of Nigeria and he must be the president this year. The 2019 presidential election was marred with electoral illegalities, which prevented Atiku from having outright victory and so, the court will do the needful by giving him his stolen mandate as destined by God because God and human have hatred on Buhari for forsaking them. “It is time for Buhari to leave the seat. He is doing what he is doing because he feels he has monopoly of power,” Ofomba declared.
