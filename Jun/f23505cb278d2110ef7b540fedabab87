These spirits have made us be one of the best legislators in the country.” The outgoing speaker thanked the members for the cooperation, perseverance and trust he enjoyed. “This was no doubt the secret that made us to excel and record these achievements that surpassed the record of our predecessors, and I assure you that history will judge us right in the future,” he said.
