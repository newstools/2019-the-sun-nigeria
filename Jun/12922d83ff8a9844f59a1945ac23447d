Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja President Muhammmadu Buhari has charged the Super Eagles as they file out in the African Cup of Nations (AFCON 2019), holding in Egypt, to play every match for the honour of motherland. He also enjoined the Super Eagles to be mindful of fair play, and approach the game with the spirit of sportsmanship, as they strive to return home with the AFCON trophy. In a statement by Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, Buhari urged them to lift the flag of Nigeria high, and reinforce the reputation of the country as football powerhouse on the continent. “I will be watching, just as millions of Nigerians would also do. You have our solid support, and we will cheer you to victory,” President Buhari said. He noted that football is a strong unifying force for Nigerians, and urged the Super Eagles to provide a soothing balm to the many challenges facing the country, which the government is confronting with everything at its disposal. “Nigerians are known for their unconquerable spirit. Show this in the group stages, and even beyond. Nothing but lifting of the diadem is good enough for our country,” he stated.
