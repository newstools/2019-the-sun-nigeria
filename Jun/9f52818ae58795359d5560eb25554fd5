The Assembly also solicited the support and cooperation of all Abians for the administration of Governor Ikpeazu, to encourage him to actualise his promises and plans for the development and well-being of the people of the state. Meanwhile, the Assembly has congratulated those who won elections at all levels in the state, urging them to shun selfishness and work for the benefit of the state and Nigeria. The Assembly also congratulated President Muhammadu Buhari for finding the former deputy governor of the state, Dr. Chris Akomas, worthy to be appointed a member of the Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission.
