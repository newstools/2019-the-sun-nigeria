The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Taraba University Chapter has suspended its two months old strike following the agreement between the union and the Taraba State Government, owner of the university. Dr Samuel Shikaa, the ASUU branch Chairman, disclosed this shortly after a meeting of the union in Jalingo on Friday. According to Shikaa, the offers that were given to the union  by government were “partially considered and approved by our Congress” and that it was based on that strength that the strike was suspended. The ASUU Chairman also stated that the implementation of some parts of the agreement had commenced.
