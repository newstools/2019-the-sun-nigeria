President of United States, Donald Trump, has been accused of rape by writer E Jean Carroll. She revealed the incident happened in the 1990s. As her account gained global attention, Trump put out a statement dismissing the allegations. He claimed he never “met this person” and accused her of using his name to sell her book. Interestingly, Carroll seemed prepared for this response.
