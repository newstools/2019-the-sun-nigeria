The Management of the University of Abuja, (UNIABUJA) on Saturday organised a send forth ceremony for Prof. Michael Adikwu, the outgoing Vice Chancellor of the institution. Alhahi Sani Maikudi, Chairman Governing Council of the institution said the school had witnessed all-round improvement in terms of physical and academic development in the five years spent by Adikwu. “On behalf of the governing council and management, we say thank you for all what you have done for the institution,” Maikudi said. Earlier, Prof Clement Alawa, Vice Chancellor Academic, commended Adikwu for a job well-done, saying his record speaks for itself. Mr Suleiman Rabiu, President of the Student Union Government of the institution said the students would remember the VC for his excellent performance. He added that Adikwu was a VC of the students and for the students, saying that before now the institution was rated 105 by the National University Commission (NUC), but now it is at number nine.

Mrs Rifkatu Swanta, Registrar of the institution equally urged all members of staff to emulate Adikwu by contributing their quarter to its growth and development. “We need a peaceful cohabitation and if we do the needful following his example, then in the next five years, we will be better than where we are today,” she said. She, therefore, called on the staff to give their support to the incoming VC of the institution, adding that it is better to build on success than to maintain it. (NAN)
