Louis Ibah Following the Ebola Virus scare which went viral earlier in the week, the Federal Government on Thursday dispatched officials from the Ministry of Health to ensure that the facilities of Port Health Service (PHS) at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos were at their optimal capacity to curtail the entry of a carrier of the virus into the country. This comes even as Port Health workers at the Lagos airport while demonstrating their capacity to curtail the entrance of an infected ebola passenger into the country complained to the visiting  government team of inadequate personnel noting that they had only one medical doctor at the airport, while nurses were retiring in droves without replacement. The government team was led by Mr. Abdulazeez Abdullahi, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Health who debunked rumours making the rounds that an ebola infected passenger had entered the country through the Lagos international airport. In the same vein, Abdullahi assured that extra steps were taken in the screening of in-bound passengers to ensure that those infected by the virus didn’t not gain access into the country. “I am here on a familiarisation visit to access the facilities on ground. On the issue of the Ebola Virus scare,  there is no truth in the earlier rumour that a traveller with Ebola Virus entered the country,” he said. “On inadequate personnel and the complaints of the service at the airport, iI have noted all that. We have excess of staff (in the country) and this thing will be addressed. I can assure you that more personnel would be deployed to this airport very soon,” added Abdullahi.
