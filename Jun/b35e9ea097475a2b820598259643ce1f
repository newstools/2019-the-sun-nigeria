President Muhammadu Buhari has renamed the Abuja National Stadium as Moshood Abiola National Stadium, crowning the national atonement for the injustice of June 12. Buhari renamed the Stadium in his speech marking the Democracy Day Celebration in Abuja. “As we all know, correcting injustice is a pre-requisite for peace and unity. As part of the process of healing and reconciliation, I approved the recognition of June 12 as Democracy Day and invested the late Chief M.K.O. Abiola and Babagana Kingibe with National Honours, as I did with the late Chief Gani Fawehinmi. The purpose was to partially atone for the previous damage done in annulling the Presidential elections of that year. “Today, I propose the re-naming of the Abuja National Stadium. Henceforth it will be called MOSHOOD ABIOLA NATIONAL STADIUM.”
