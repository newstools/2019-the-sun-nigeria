Molly Kilete, Abuja The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) says its fighter jets on counterinsurgency operations in the northeast have bombarded more terrorist locations at Sambisa Forest in Borno State. NAF Director of Public Relations and Information Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, stated that, “In continuation of its sustained air strikes against terrorists’ targets in Borno State, the Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation LAFIYA DOLE has severely degraded another Boko Haram Terrorists (BHTs) hideout in the Sambisa Forest. “The operation was executed yesterday, 16 June 2019, after persistent Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions revealed heavy presence of BHTs at a new camp with several structures hidden under the thick foliage of the Forest. Accordingly, the ATF dispatched an Alpha Jet to attack the location. “Its bombs hit the target area, with devastating effects on several of the camouflaged structures, neutralizing their BHT occupants. “The NAF, operating in concert with surface forces, will sustain the effort to completely degrade the terrorists in the Northeast.”
