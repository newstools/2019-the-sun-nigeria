Speaking on abandoned babies and missing children, Augie said; “ this occurs as a result of illegitimate conceptions by young mothers. In handling this, Hisbah follows due process by reporting first to the security agencies such as the police and then, to local government and hospital for medical examinations and then send them to the orphanage. In all, the committee received a total of 52 cases. “Cases of missing children are often reported to Hisbah where committee uses mass media to make announcements. In this way, we recorded huge successes by reuniting these children with their parents or guardians. A total of 363 cases were treated.”he stated.
