The two labour unions at the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), have reassured Nigerians, the Federal Government and FIRS management that they will ensure that the N8.8 trillion revenue target for 2019 is realised. Comrade Okere Samson, Chairman, FIRS chapter of the Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria (ASCSN), and Comrade Idris Hassan of the Nigerian Civil Service Union, NCSU (FIRS chapter), gave the assurance during the week after their meetings with FIRS Chairman, Tunde Fowler.
