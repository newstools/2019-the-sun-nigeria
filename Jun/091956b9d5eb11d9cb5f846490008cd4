As senators-elect prepare to elect the principal officers of their choice, including the Senate president and his deputy, the former Governor of Imo, Rochas Okorocha’s name was missing from the list of lawmakers-elect from the state. This was revealed when the Clerk of the National Assembly, Mohammed Sani-Omolori, on Tuesday, read out the roll call of eligible senators-elect from all states and the FCT for the Tuesday’s election in Abuja. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Okorocha, who got the court’s nod as senator-elect for Imo West, is yet to be issued a certificate of return by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Out of the three slots for senators from Imo, only senator-elect Ezenwa Onyewuchi (PDP) from Imo East was mentioned at the chamber. The election of Mr Benjamin Uwajumogu for Imo North is yet to be determined.
