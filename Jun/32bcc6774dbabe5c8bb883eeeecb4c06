The visitors were led by Senior Vice President Operations in charge of Middle East and Africa, Christian Chappelle.

The PSA team was in Kaduna to discuss mutual business interest and review their technical partnership with PAN. Following what a PAN Nigeria management source described as a brief, but very cordial interaction which led to fruitful resolutions, the guests concluded their visit with a tour of the expansive Peugeot plant. The Technical Coordinator DMOA PSA, Plant performance and Evaluation, Nouredinne El Ftouhi, described the PAN plant as huge and brilliant investment, and commended the PAN management for keeping it in excellent shape.
