LAYI OLANREWAJU, Ilorin Kwara State government has clarified that it has not sacked any worker — new or old. This is contrary to the rumour which has gone viral regarding certain category of workers purported to have been hurriedly engaged by the immediate past administration. A statement issued by the Deputy Chief Press Secretary (DCPS) to Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazak, Agboola Olarewaju said “the category of workers not paid for the month of May were those who were employed only two or three weeks ago but had their employment letters dubiously backdated to November 2018.” According to the DCPS, “most of these workers have never been captured on the government’s payroll before — and so couldn’t have been paid May salary. “Those appointments are called ‘sunset’ appointments (appointments made by a governor/administration on the eve of departure). “Instead of summary sack, what the government resolved to do is to look at their qualifications and ascertain that they are qualified to be employed. In Ogun, Bauchi and some other states, ‘sunset’ employees were sacked with immediate effect. “While former Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed did not deem it fit to employ them until a few weeks to leaving office, some were employed last week and (and their employment) backdated to November 2018 (last year). “In 2003, former Governor Bukola Saraki sacked all of the late Governor Mohammed Lawal’s sunset appointments and also demoted some civil servants.” While lamenting that a dubious interview process was conducted in which only cronies of the last administration were employed over and above those that excelled with flying colours, Olarewaju said “these sunset workers have not been sacked; their employment status will be looked into and salaries reinstated for those above board.” function insertAfter(e,t){t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t.nextSibling)}function getElementByXPath(e,t){if(!t)t=document;if(t.evaluate)return t.evaluate(e,document,null,9,null).singleNodeValue;while(e.charAt(0)=="/")e=e.substr(1);var n=t;var r=e.split("/");for(var i=0;i<r.length;i++){var a=r[i].split(/(\w*)\[(\d*)\]/gi).filter(function(e){return!(e==""||e.match(/\s/gi))},this);var l=a[0];var o=a[1]?a[1]-1:0;if(i<r.length-1)n=n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o];else return n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o]}}if(!Array.prototype.filter){Array.prototype.filter=function(e){var t=this.length>>>0;if(typeof e!="function"){throw new TypeError}var n=[];var r=arguments[1];for(var i=0;i<t;i++){if(i in this){var a=this[i];if(e.call(r,a,i,this)){n.push(a)}}}return n}}function injectWidgetByXpath(e){var t=getElementByXPath(e);if(t==null){t=document.getElementById("tbdefault")}innerInject(t)}function injectWidgetByMarker(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);innerInject(t.parentNode)}function innerInject(e){var t=document.createElement("span");var n=document.createElement("script");var r="if JS crashes here, the first innerHTML value should be enclosed with single quotes instead of double, go to the minified version and change it";t.innerHTML="<div id='taboola-below-article'></div><div id='taboola-below-article-second'></div>";n.innerHTML="window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-c', container:'taboola-below-article', placement:'below-article', target_type: 'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-d', container:'taboola-below-article-second', placement:'below-article-2nd', target_type: 'mix'});";insertAfter(t,e);insertAfter(n,t)}injectWidgetByMarker('tbmarker');
