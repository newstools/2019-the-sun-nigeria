The deputy governor who observed the three Rakat prayers alongside the Emir of Minna, Alhaji Umar Farouk Bahago, and other Muslims faithful, said the traditional institution has a great role to play in addressing the current situation, saying that as custodians of the people, they should be able to fish out the bad eggs in their communities.
