(BBC) Ukraine came from behind to beat South Korea 3-1 and win their first Under-20 World Cup. The match – in Lodz, Poland – featured two teams playing in the final for the first time in their history. South Korea led through an early penalty, which Lee Kang-in fired past Real Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin. But Vladyslav Supriaha scored either side of half-time and Dynamo Kiev club-mate Heorhii Tsitaishvili sped away to add a late third. Korea almost equalised at 2-1 but 20-year-old Lunin, who spent last season on loan with Leganes in La Liga, brilliantly tipped Lee Jae-ik’s header on to the crossbar. Ukraine – who did not qualify in 2017 – topped a group containing the USA, Nigeria and Qatar, before beating Panama 4-1 in the last 16, Colombia 1-0 in the quarter-final and Italy 1-0 in the semis. Norway’s Erling Braut Haaland won the Golden Boot with nine goals, all in one game – a 12-0 group win over Honduras, his side’s last game of the tournament. Defending champions England failed to qualify for the finals.
