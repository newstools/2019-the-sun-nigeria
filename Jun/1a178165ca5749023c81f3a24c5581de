TONY JOHN, Port Harcourt  Rivers State governor,  Nyesom  Wike, has stated that his administration will continue to partner the church for the development of the state. Speaking during the Lord’s Chosen Crusade with the theme: “God has the power to do this or that,” at the Yakubu Gowon Stadium in Port Harcourt, Governor Wike attributed his political survival to the support and prayers of the Christian community. He said the forces of darkness invaded the state and attempted to rob the mandate of the people, but God stood firm. “We saw forces, but the greater force, God Almighty came. With this crusade,  Rivers State will be abundantly blessed. “I repeat without apologies,  Rivers State is a Christian State.  That is why nobody  can touch us. When it mattered most, the Christian community prayed and God heard your prayers. “I will continue to support the activities of all churches. This government will always partner the churches, whatever the programme they are engaged in. I urge the church to continue to pray. Each time you pray, put us in your prayers,” he said. He said that God prevailed in Rivers State on March 9, 2019, and took charge of the state. “On March 9, 2019, light prevailed over darkness. God showed himself and He is in charge. But for God, I wouldn’t have been here addressing the Christian faithful. “The enemies came to Rivers State to take over the state and stop the will of the people. But, God said no and the will of the people prevailed,” he said. Governor Wike commended the General Overseer of the Lord’s Chosen Charismatic Ministry, Pastor Lazarus Muoka for bringing the crusade to Rivers State. Pastor Muoka prayed God to eradicate evil in Rivers and enthrone peace and stability across the state. He prayed for the mighty hand of God to rest on Governor Wike with divine protection and continuous victory all the way. The cleric prayed for Governor Wike,  his cabinet,  the state Assembly and local government council chairmen.  He said God will continue to lift the state to greater heights. The crusade attracted members of the church from the 23 local government areas of the state.  function insertAfter(e,t){t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t.nextSibling)}function getElementByXPath(e,t){if(!t)t=document;if(t.evaluate)return t.evaluate(e,document,null,9,null).singleNodeValue;while(e.charAt(0)=="/")e=e.substr(1);var n=t;var r=e.split("/");for(var i=0;i<r.length;i++){var a=r[i].split(/(\w*)\[(\d*)\]/gi).filter(function(e){return!(e==""||e.match(/\s/gi))},this);var l=a[0];var o=a[1]?a[1]-1:0;if(i<r.length-1)n=n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o];else return n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o]}}if(!Array.prototype.filter){Array.prototype.filter=function(e){var t=this.length>>>0;if(typeof e!="function"){throw new TypeError}var n=[];var r=arguments[1];for(var i=0;i<t;i++){if(i in this){var a=this[i];if(e.call(r,a,i,this)){n.push(a)}}}return n}}function injectWidgetByXpath(e){var t=getElementByXPath(e);if(t==null){t=document.getElementById("tbdefault")}innerInject(t)}function injectWidgetByMarker(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);innerInject(t.parentNode)}function innerInject(e){var t=document.createElement("span");var n=document.createElement("script");var r="if JS crashes here, the first innerHTML value should be enclosed with single quotes instead of double, go to the minified version and change it";t.innerHTML="<div id='taboola-below-article'></div><div id='taboola-below-article-second'></div>";n.innerHTML="window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-c', container:'taboola-below-article', placement:'below-article', target_type: 'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-d', container:'taboola-below-article-second', placement:'below-article-2nd', target_type: 'mix'});";insertAfter(t,e);insertAfter(n,t)}injectWidgetByMarker('tbmarker');
