As the 32nd edition of Africa’s premier football competition, the African Cup of Nations, gets underway today, one of the major sponsors of the Super Eagles, Nigerian Breweries Plc through its Star Lager beer is taking the support for the team to a higher level. A television commercial would be unveiled today by Star Lager beer, the premium supporter of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) and official beer of the Super Eagles. The commercial was geared towards inspiring the Nigerian national team to soar to greater heights to win the African Cup of Nations for the fourth time. Ahead of the unveiling, the Portfolio Manager, National Premium, Nigerian Breweries Plc, Mrs. Sarah Agha said the idea was to bring Nigerian  football fans to stand behind the team all through the matches the national team will play at the tournament. “Nigerians are very passionate about football and we want to galvanise them to stand behind the Super Eagles as they hope to conquer Africa again. Star Lager as a foremost brand when it comes to entertainment, our consumers and numerous fans are in for wonderful moments of football. “The television commercial is part of our own way to use Star Lager to spread the message of total support to the team as they go out with the mission to conquer in the Land of Pharoahs,” she remarked. As expected, the fans that will visit the Star Fan parks across the country during the tournament will see the television commercial, as it would be played repeatedly before, during and after the matches in real time. In all, 10 dedicated Fan Parks in nine cities namely Uyo, Port Harcourt, Aba, Enugu, Onitsha, Abeokuta, Abuja, Jos and multiple centers in Lagos  have been selected by the brand to give Nigerian fans memorable experiences where fans can in carnival like environment enjoy the 52 matches of the competition, which runs from June 21st to July 12th, 2019.
