Family members and friends of a staunch member of the Indigenous People of Biafra ( IPOB) , Mr Madu Manuel Sunday , who has been missing since 2016 has cried to the Federal Government to bring him back  dead or alive . The family  alleged that he has not returned home or seen after his house  in Umunneochi, Anambra State , was raided by security agencies  since 2016. According to the family ,during the raid ,three people were  reportedly killed while many were  injured . The family also alleged that on February 3, at about 2pm , security agents still stormed  Sunday’s residents claiming that they were still searching for IPOB members who the Federal Government  had declared  a terrorist organization  since September  20 ,2017. Spokesman for the family , John Sunday said: “ We have been searching for our brother , an Engineer, since 2016 that his house was raided. We have not reached him. We can no longer bear the pains. Joint security operation carried out the  inversion  of his home where a lot of casualty was recorded “  Sunday was last seen in public since 2016. He  was being hunted by the government because of his roles and participation in 2011 General election. His brothers and mother were not spared  as they are being harassed by security agents. One of his aides , Segum Timothy ,was killed by gunmen who also stormed his   Lagos  residence.  He committed no offence, rather than that he was a front line campaigner for the actualization of the IPOB and that they were using his residence for Umunneochi chapter monthly meeting by IPOB . Also his  political activities posed a threat to the  ruling party. His country home has been locked up and under siege since he  defected from the All Nigerians Peoples Party to All Progressive Grand Alliance in 2005. The development did  not  go down well with some politicians in Nigeria  as APGA is   perceived  as  an Igbo agenda party and sympathetic  to the agitation of Biafra Republic.
