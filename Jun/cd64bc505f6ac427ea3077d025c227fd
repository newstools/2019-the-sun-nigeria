An 89-year-old man has been buried with piles of newspaper in central Uganda as part of his dying wish, according to New Vision newspaper. Dodoviko Ssenyonjo was a reportedly a dedicated reader of local newspapers, and did not trust that relatives would keep his collection after he died. “Rarely would he be seen without a copy of his newspaper,” a local shopkeeper told New Vision.
