Bright Omokaro, an ex-international says the Super Falcons match against the host country at the ongoing FIFA 2019 Women’s World Cup would not be a walk in the park but that the team could beat France with dedication. Omokaro made the assertion in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos.
NAN reports that Super Falcons defeated South Korea 2-0 making it the first win for the team at the ongoing World Cup in France. “I believe this victory will encourage them to push harder and focus on what’s important, they need to listen to their coach, this is going to be one of the most crucial encounters and they need to put in their best. “France can be beaten, but they need to have the mentality of a champion, that’s what they need to do, France is not a team to underrate but playing confidently too will go a long way,’’ he said.
NAN reports that Super Falcons lost its opening match against Norway 3-0.
