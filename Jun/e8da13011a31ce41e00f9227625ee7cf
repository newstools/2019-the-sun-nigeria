Clement Adeyi, Osogbo Osun State House of Assembly, yesterday, inaugurated the seventth Assembly and elected a new speaker. The new speaker, Timothy Owoeye, represents Ilesa East Constituency.

Owoeye, a four-term legislator, was nominated by Tunde Olatunji representing Ife North Constituency, while Elizabeth Abioye representing Ifedayo Constituency seconded the motion. Femi Popoola representing Boripe State Constituency emerged the deputy speaker, while Babatunde Olatunji, Ife-North State Constituency, was elected as chief whip. Other newly inaugurated members of the Assembly include Morufu Olarewaju (Irewole State Constituency) as the majority leader; Moshood Akande (Olorunda State Constituency) as the deputy majority leader and Gbenga Ogunkanmi (Ayedire State Constituency) as deputy chief whip.
