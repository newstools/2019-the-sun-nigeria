The Muslim League for Accountability (MULAC), an NGO, on Thursday urged President Muhammad Buhari to give priority attention to reviving nation’s moribund industries in his second term in office. The Executive Director of the organisation, Malam Yusuf Arrigasiyyu, gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Kaduna. Arrigasiyyu said by reviving the industries, such as textile, Ajaokuta Steel Company among others would go a long way in creating more employment as well as reducing the rate of insecurity in the country. According to him, no nation could achieve any meaningful development without having functional industries. “We want the president in his second term to appoint honest and credible youths in his cabinet so as to help in piloting the affairs of the country.” READ ALSO: Court remands 4 for defiling, impregnating 15 year-old girl The Executive Director also urged the president to overhaul the security architecture of the country to address it headlong.
