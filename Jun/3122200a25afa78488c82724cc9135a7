He said the injured were taken to Idera Hospital, Sagamu, while the corpse of the dead victim was deposited at FOS Morgue, Ipara. Oladele advised motorists to drive cautiously, especially on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, which is currently undergoing rehabilitation. “Motorists should, therefore, expect traffic to build up on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and other corridors following the celebration of the Eid-el-Fitr, with several motorists returning to resume work,” he said.
