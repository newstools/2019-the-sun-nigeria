She said she sent her little girl to get some food from the kitchen,  when she came back from school last Friday, while the suspect was busy with his plumbing job near their apartment. She explained that while the girl wasted some time, she (the mother) dozed off at the sitting room. The victim said the suspect waylaid her as she was going to ease herself before going to  the kitchen and allegedly began to touch her and finally defiled her in the presence of her six-year-old younger brother, who later reported the act to their mother hours later. Father of the victim, Chinwendu Elom, a trader said it was discovered that the girl was bleeding from her private part and was rushed to a private hospital for medication.
