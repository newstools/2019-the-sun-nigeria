Desmond Mgboh, Kano The new Emir of Rano, Alhaji Tafida Ila Autan Bawo, has suspended two district heads in his emirate council following alleged acts of insubordination and disloyalty as crisis continued to rock the traditional institution in the state. The affected district heads are those of Bebeji, Alhaji Haruna Sanusi, who had a few weeks ago, announced his resignation from office in solidarity with the embattled Emir of Kano, Alhaji Muhammadu Sanusi, but later disowned the said letter for unknown reasons. It was also gathered that Emir of Rano, also suspended the District Head of Tudun Wada, Dr. Bashir Muhammad. The duo was, in the light of their suspension, automatically discharged of their titles as the “Dan Galadima Kano” and “Dan Kadai Tudun Wada” respectively. The suspension of the pair was conveyed to them via a letter issued by the Secretary to Rano Emirate Council, Alhaji Muhammad Idris Rano. In the suspension letter, they were accused of acts of disrespect and insubordination, manifested in their refusal to participate in the just-concluded Sallah festivities in the emirate, despite the fact that they were duly communicated to and invited in advance. According to the Emirate Secretary, in the letter of suspension, the state Ministry of Local Government and their respective local government councils have been duly informed of their suspension. Our correspondent’s investigation indicated that despite a clear directive issued by the state government instructing all district heads to pay total allegiance to their new emirs, many of the traditional had continued to revert to Alhaji Muhammad Sanusi as their leader. During the just-concluded Sallah activities, many district heads shunned the religious ceremonies that were held in their immediate emirates while a reasonable number of them secretly sent representation to the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Muhammad Sanusi, to the dissatisfaction of the authorities. function insertAfter(e,t){t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t.nextSibling)}function getElementByXPath(e,t){if(!t)t=document;if(t.evaluate)return t.evaluate(e,document,null,9,null).singleNodeValue;while(e.charAt(0)=="/")e=e.substr(1);var n=t;var r=e.split("/");for(var i=0;i<r.length;i++){var a=r[i].split(/(\w*)\[(\d*)\]/gi).filter(function(e){return!(e==""||e.match(/\s/gi))},this);var l=a[0];var o=a[1]?a[1]-1:0;if(i<r.length-1)n=n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o];else return n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o]}}if(!Array.prototype.filter){Array.prototype.filter=function(e){var t=this.length>>>0;if(typeof e!="function"){throw new TypeError}var n=[];var r=arguments[1];for(var i=0;i<t;i++){if(i in this){var a=this[i];if(e.call(r,a,i,this)){n.push(a)}}}return n}}function injectWidgetByXpath(e){var t=getElementByXPath(e);if(t==null){t=document.getElementById("tbdefault")}innerInject(t)}function injectWidgetByMarker(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);innerInject(t.parentNode)}function innerInject(e){var t=document.createElement("span");var n=document.createElement("script");var r="if JS crashes here, the first innerHTML value should be enclosed with single quotes instead of double, go to the minified version and change it";t.innerHTML="<div id='taboola-below-article'></div><div id='taboola-below-article-second'></div>";n.innerHTML="window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-c', container:'taboola-below-article', placement:'below-article', target_type: 'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-d', container:'taboola-below-article-second', placement:'below-article-2nd', target_type: 'mix'});";insertAfter(t,e);insertAfter(n,t)}injectWidgetByMarker('tbmarker');
