Dismissing the applications, the Justice Mohammed Garba-led tribunal held that the petitioners did file their application for the issuance of pre-hearing notice within the time stipulated by law. Justice Garba, who read the lead ruling, held that the pleadings were closed on April 20, when the petitioners filed their reply to the last-received reply of President Buhari to the petition. He, therefore, held the application for the issuance of pre-hearing notice filed by the petitioners on April 30, was within the seven days period stipulated by law and deemed to be proper. He dismissed the applications by INEC and Buhari for lacking in merit. The tribunal also dismissed an application by the petitioners seeking that judgment be delivered in their favour on the grounds of alleged tardiness of the INEC, Buhari, and APC.
