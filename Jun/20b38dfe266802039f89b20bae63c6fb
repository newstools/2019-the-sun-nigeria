Worried about the growing insecurity in the region, governors of the South West zone have decided to hold a regional security summit that will bring all critical stakeholders together to brainstorm on how to stem the tide.
Speaking after a special meeting at the Ondo State Governor’s Lodge in Abuja on Friday, Governor Rotimi Akeredolu said the DAWN Commission has been directed to coordinate the summit aimed at further promoting the developmental agenda of the South West region.
“There’s an urgent need to stem the growth of criminal activities and banditry in our region and as leaders, we must be proactive in our approach to addressing the issue,” Akeredolu said.
He stated further that a consulting firm, KPMG has been appointed to review the tenure of the Group Managing Director of Oodua Investment Company, which has all the SouthWest State governments as shareholders.
The meeting, which was attended by governors of Lagos Babajide Sanwo-Olu; Ondo, Rotimi Akeredolu; Ekiti, Kayode Fayemi; Oyo, Seyi Makinde and Osun, Gboyega Oyetola, unanimously adopted Mr. Akeredolu as the chairman of the South West Governors’ Forum. The Forum resolved to reconvene at a later date for further deliberations.
