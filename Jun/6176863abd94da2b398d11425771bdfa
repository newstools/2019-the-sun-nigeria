According to him, Section (18) 4 of the Kano State Public Complaints And Anti- Corruption Law 2008 (as amended), empowers the commission “not to be subjected to the direction and control of any authority in the exercise of its powers under the law.” He recalled that the commission’s  investigation of Kano Emirate Council was at the instance of the state government, adding that it had to commence its work following a series of complaints by the citizens of the state. Rimingado maintained that their preliminary investigation was only for the government to act administratively so that the commission could continue to exercise its responsibilities, without interferences. Rimingado said their “preliminary report is just a tip of the iceberg of the commission’s findings.” He recalled that “the commission received a petition filed by Concerned Friends of Kano Emirate dated 28th March, 2017, on allegations of financial misappropriation against Kano Emirate Council. “The petitioners raised some allegations bordering on spending of funds belonging to Kano Emirate Council without appropriation and regards to due process,” he stated. “During the period, the commission used its powers under Section 8,9,15 of the Kano State Public Complaints ad Anti – Corruption Commission Law 2008 and launched an investigation which culminated into the issuance of preliminary investigation report forwarded to the government on 31st may 2019.”
