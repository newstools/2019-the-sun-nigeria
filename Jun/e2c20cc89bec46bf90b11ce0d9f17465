This is contained in a press statement issued yesterday by the national coordinator of the group, Comrade Osanieye Ikpomwonba and made available to newsmen in Benin. “We pass a vote of confidence on the national working committee of the APC led by its national chairman, comrade Adams Oshiomhole and we also challenge them to be above board, ensuring equity, justice and reward to every single member of the party for posterity sake”, the statement said.
