Trading activities on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) closed northward on Friday, amid quarter end window dressing and low price attraction. The All-Share Index inched 217.52 points or 0.73 per cent to close at 29,966.87 against 29,749.35 achieved on Thursday. In the same vein, the market capitalisation which opened at N13.109 trillion rose by N96 billion or 0.73 per cent to close at N13.205 trillion. Mr Ambrose Omordion, the Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Ltd., attributed the development to quarter end window dressing embarked on by some institutional and portfolio investors. Omordion said that low price attraction contributed to the reversal being witnessed on the nation’s bourse, with most equities trading below their intrinsic value.
