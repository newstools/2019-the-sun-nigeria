Mohammad Barau, attributed the company’s impressive performance to the support given to it by the NNPC Management which helped to resolve some of its challenges and motivated the company to embark on an aggressive drive for customers, resulting in increased earnings. The company’s total revenue for the year 2018 was ₦243.630billion compared to ₦275.162billion for 2017. The decline in revenue was attributed to the move by the electric power generating companies to purchase gas directly from gas producers since June 2018. The NGMC is mainly engaged in sourcing, marketing and distribution of natural gas to major industrial users and utility companies in Nigeria and the West Africa sub-region.
