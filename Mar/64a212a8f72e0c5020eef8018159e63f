Fred Itua, Abuja Over 100,000 aggrieved corps members who served as ad hoc staff in the recently conducted general election have dragged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to court over unpaid allowances amounting to N7 billion. The case is currently before a Federal Capital Territory high court, in Gwagwalada, Abuja. According to the aggrieved corps members, INEC has refused to compensate them, following the postponement of the February 16 presidential and National Assembly elections, despite a series of petitions addressed to the commission. In the court paper filed on behalf of Ifemenam Ozioma and National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) ad hoc staff, lawyer to the plaintiff, Amobi Nzelu, said INEC has deliberately refused to pay each staff N15,000, which it initially agreed to pay to the claimant. Briefing newsmen, Nzelu said: “I have the full authority and consent of my principal, as well as the plaintiff and those she is representing to depose to affidavit. By virtue of my position, I am very conversant with the facts of this case. “On the 20th day of February, 2019, I wrote a letter to the INEC, demanding, on behalf of the ad hoc staff, the payment of both the stimulation and induction course allowance of N8,000 and N15,000 for the elections.”
