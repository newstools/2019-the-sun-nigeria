Rose Ejembi, Makurdi The Idoma and Igede ethnic nationalities in Benue, Ochetoha K’ Idoma and Omi Ny’ Igede socio-cultural organizations have debunked claims that they would team up with Fulani to vote out Governor Samuel Ortom this Saturday. The two socio-cultural groups, in a statement jointly signed by their Presidents, Amali Amali and Comrade Ben Okpa noted that the statement credited to the National Coordinator of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), Garus Gololo in the media (not Sun) was untrue. They stated that the organizations are non-political and do not intend to delve into politics adding that, “we do not have anything  in common with Mr. Garus Gololo and his MACBAN that has been unleashing mayhem on the citizens of Benue State. We have never met with MACBAN and do not intend to meet with them at any time and in any occasion to remove Governor Samuel Ortom as envisaged.” While describing the publication as mischievous and an attempt to incite the Tiv ethnic group against the Idoma and Igede ethnic groups, Amali and Okpa posited that Benue people are matured politically enough to vote for politicians of their choice rather than teaming up with MACBAN to remove the governor. “We dissociate ourselves in strong terms from the publication and urge the general to equally disregard the publication in totality. The information published is an evil imagination of the author please,” the statement added.
