Obinna Odogwu, Abakaliki  Twenty-four members-elect of the Ebonyi State House of Assembly have received their certificates of return from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).  The certificates were issued to them at the headquarters of the commission in Abakaliki, the state capital in the presence of some People’s Democratic Party (PDP) faithful, leadership, and the wives of the male members-elect.  The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Prof. Godswill Obioma, announced that the state governor-elect, Chief David Umahi, and the deputy governor-elect, Dr Kelechi Igwe, would receive their own certificates of return on a later date.  Umahi, according to the REC, took permission from the national headquarters of INEC through its state office that he would be unavoidably absent.  The incoming lawmakers were all elected on the platform of the PDP.  Speaking at the ceremony Prof. Obioma, commended the staff of the commission for ‘diligent service’ carried out during the polls.  “I think we have done relatively well. We have been adjudged to have conducted the best election in the state. We thank the people of Ebonyi for behaving well,” Obioma said.  Speaking on behalf of the members-elect, Francis Nwifuru of Izzi West constituency, thanked the Ebonyi electorate for finding them worthy to be so elected.  Nwifuru, who is the current Speaker of the state House of Assembly, said that the incoming lawmakers, as soon as they were inaugurated, would hit the ground running to ensure that they justify the confidence reposed in them by their people who voted for them.
