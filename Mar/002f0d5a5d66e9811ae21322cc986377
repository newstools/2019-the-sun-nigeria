It is with immense pleasure that the Board and Management of The Sun Publishing Limited write to formally inform you that you have emerged the winner of the annual prestigious award of The Sun Courage in Leadership for 2018. The Board of Editors voted His Excellency in recognition of your show of courage in handling the affairs of Borno State as governor as well as other assignments, in the quest for the socio-economic and political development of Nigeria. In the last seven and half years as governor of Borno State, His Excellency has exhibited tremendous courage in things he does, making him a remarkable leader, technocrat in government and fearless politician. Right from 2011 when you assumed office, at the height of Boko Haram insurgency, you have proved that courage, sacrifice and love for the people are the hallmark of leadership. You have remained focused, resolute and determined to cater to the needs of the people, in the face of territory snatching and occupation by Boko Haram, threat to life and expenditure of huge sum of money on security. In 2015, when some APC members accused the South East of not contributing anything to President Muhammadu Buhari’s victory, His Excellency came in defence of the Igbo, declaring that the mere fact that the PDP could not record high votes in the South East, as seen in 2011, was enough contribution to APC’s victory by the people of the region. The world noted your role at ensuring that the quit notice issued last year by some northern youths to the Igbo residing in the North was withdrawn. You met with the northern youths, northern governors, northern elders and stakeholders as well as their Igbo counterparts to ensure that all the issues were ironed out and resolved, which led to the withdrawal of the quit notice to Igbo to leave the North. Your Excellency did all these at the risk of your life and that of your family. It is for these feats, among others, that The Sun has deemed it appropriate to celebrate His Excellency. The Sun Courage in Leadership Award is bestowed annually on that person who has exhibited rear courage in what he or she does, irrespective of the inherent danger and losses and by so doing has inspired hope for a better Nigeria. To celebrate this award, we, therefore, invite you to join other awardees in The Sun Awards presentation ceremony scheduled to hold by 5pm on Friday, January 25, 2019 at the Expo Hall of Eko Hotels & Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos. We heartily congratulation you as we look forward to seeing you, alongside other state government officials, APC chieftains, political associates, family and friends on the occasion.
