Zika Bobby In a renewed drive to boost its after-sales service delivery capacity, Panasonic Africa Division, along with its Nigerian partner, Panaserv Nigeria Limited, promoters of the Panasonic brand of electronics in Nigeria, has organised a special training programme in Lagos and Abuja for its key technical staff, channel partners and freelance technicians and engineers on air conditioners installation and repairs. The two-day training, which held on March 19 and 20 in Lagos and Abuja respectively, attracted delegates and engineers from Panasonic Japan, Malaysia Factory and from Regional Head Quarters in Dubai as major resource as well as the best of the companyâ€™s core technical staff in all the Panaserv service centres in Lagos, Abuja, Kano, Port Harcourt and Enugu. Speaking on the essence of the training, a chief trainer from Panasonic, Premsankar Vijayan, said delivering this skill enhancement for all technical partners is an activity that is ingrained in the culture of the organisation, reaffirming that the company would continue to empower more technicians with requisite skills. Vijayan said the training would deepen the pool of well-trained technicians that would not only assist the company in offering after-sale services to its customers but also help to bridge the technical skills gap in Nigeria.
