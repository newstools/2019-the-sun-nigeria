PHD Nigeria has been selected as one of the winners of the Global Public Relations Initiative competition, “Amplify Fund,” organised by PHD Worldwide across its 74 markets. The competition was aimed at awarding up to £10,000 to the country with the best idea to  project and promote PHD within its market, strengthen the brand and add value to the team. PHD Nigeria was chosen out of 19 submissions from across the world. Its idea was to create video stories on client’s success, incorporating PHD’s five values and build brand awareness for PHD Nigeria. This was executed through series of case study videos framed around PHD’s values of openness, curiosity, courage, creativity and collaboration. PHD Nigeria has therefore become the first and only African office to be selected among other winners in the highly coveted competition. In addition to the win, PHD Nigeria was recently announced as part of the top 10 PHD offices across the world for its use of SOURCE, PHD’s proprietary media strategy and planning tool, which has been part of its global success story. The Managing Director of PHD Nigeria, Dozie Okafor, said the win was a further testament to the quality of work provided to clients and expressed gratitude to those who entrusted their media budgets with the company. “With SOURCE, we have been able to deliver better strategic media planning and results to our clients,” he declared. PHD Nigeria started operations in 2010 and serves as a hub for PHD Worldwide’s operations in West Africa.
