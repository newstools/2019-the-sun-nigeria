Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa Chairman of the South South Governors’ Forum, Seriake Dickson, has congratulated governors of the region re-elected on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) as declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Dickson, who is also chairman of the South South PDP Governors’ Forum, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Public Affairs, Daniel Alabrah, said Saturday’s election was a referendum on the excellent performance of the five PDP governors in the zone. He said it is heart-warming that the mandates of his brother-governors in the region were renewed by the electorate in their various states, on Saturday, having given a good account of themselves in the last four years even as the final result of the election in Rivers State is being awaited. He expressed the hope that the will of the Rivers people would not be subverted, following INEC’s suspension of the election and the collation process in the state.
