Paul Orude Bauchi The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has decried the low turnout of voters in Saturday’s governorship and state assembly elections in Bauchi State. While briefing newsmen immediately after casting his ballot at his Central Primary School polling unit, Gwaranga, in Bogoro Local Government Area of Bauchi state, he attributed the low turnout of voters to the results of the last Presidential and National Assembly Elections,  which he claimed, were tempered with at the collation centres. While calling on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to respect the wishes of the electorate, he commended the people of his constituencies for peaceful conduct of the elections.
