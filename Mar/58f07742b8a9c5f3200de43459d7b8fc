Geoffrey Anyanwu, Awka Anambra State Governor, Willie Obiano, has reviewed his five years in office, boasting he has changed the fortunes of the state better than he met it. He said he would, in the remaining three years, expand the state’s economic performance, and promised to do more for posterity. Speaking in a message to mark the first year anniversary of his administration’s second term in office, Obiano noted that his government attracted international recognition for the developmental strides he had put in place in the state. He, however, charged his commissioners and other appointees to put in their very best, now, as he would not hesitate to sack any indolent government functionary. Forbes Magazine USA recently recommended the state government’s Community Choose your Project Initiative as a model for the development of Africa. He said: “I assure you that I’ll remain focused and will not hesitate to change anybody who is under-performing in my cabinet.” Obiano, who urged the people of the state to join hands with his government to make Anambra great, said: “I appreciate Ndi Anambra for supporting me, irrespective of political affiliations and inclinations. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the state has increased from N3 trillion to N4.2 trillion in the last five years.” The governor also identified the massive support from the members of the state House Assembly, and the achievements recorded in all sectors of the state’s economy as part of his major successes in the past five years.
