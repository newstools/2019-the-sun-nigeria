Ismail Omipidan The about 55, 000 voters in parts of Kosofe LG of Lagos that could have been disenfranchised are now heaving a sigh of relief as voting just commenced in the area. Earlier, protest by INEC ad hoc staff over non- payment of their allowance and discrepancies in voting materials sent to the area had prevented voting from taking place. But as at the time of filing this report, voting was underway; the protesting ad hoc staff had all returned to their duty posts. However, like in most parts of Lagos, there was also low turnout in a few polling units so far visited. For instance, in one of the polling units, out of the 1,004 registered voters on the list, only 30 voters have so far voted as at the time of filing this report.
