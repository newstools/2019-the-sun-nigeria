Phenomenal Annual Integrity Lecture/Award, organised by Nigerian Association of Christian Journalists (NACJ), will resonate this April with a few prominent Nigerians, who will be decorated as men and women of integrity. The annual event, which was initiated in 2013, was motivated by the strong drive of the association to contribute to the developmental progress of the country. Secretary General of NACJ, Charles Okhai, said the event is scheduled for Friday, at Sheraton Hotel, Ikeja, Lagos. He said: “We reasoned that for us to effectively contribute our quota to the progress of Nigeria, we must, of a necessity, solve, at least, one of the problems facing the country. In view of the fact that corruption is one of the major factors pulling back the country’s wheels of progress, we had to develop a panacea called integrity, to curb the menace of corruption. “We believe integrity is the direct opposite of corruption. If Nigerians, as a people, are mentally integrity conscious, especially our leaders in the corridors of power, the spate of corruption in our society will be drastically reduced. “We make bold to say we are not in the business of giving people award for the giddy excitement of it, rather, we are propelled and driven by the need to get rid of the societal monster called corruption. For us, this is a worthy venture, because no nation can attain her potential development with the scourge of corruption like we have in Nigeria today.”
