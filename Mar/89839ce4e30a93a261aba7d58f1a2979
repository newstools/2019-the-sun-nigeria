From Linus Oota, Lafia  A group of persons suspected to be herdsmen were reported to have raped to death an under-aged school girl from Mante village in Akwanga Local Government Area of Nasarawa State, All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Nasarawa State has claimed.  Earlier, the paramount ruler of Akwanga, Chun Mada, Samson Gamu-Yare, had confirmed to journalists that two villages in the area were attacked while 11 houses were razed to ashes in the wake of the attack.  APGA decried the case in a statement signed by its Nasarawa State acting chairman, Francis Yua, and issued to journalists in Lafia, but could not give the identity of the deceased victim.  The APGA statement read in parts: “Facts available to the leadership of APGA reveal that an innocent under-aged school girl from Mante village was kidnapped, raped and killed by suspected herdsmen. “When her parents rose in search of her, they were attacked and killed while houses were burnt and properties destroyed.”  Consequently, the state APGA observed with dismay the unwarranted killing of innocent people by terrorist herdsmen in Akwanga Local Government Area villages of Mante, Nidan and Katanza.  “The APGA leadership in Nasarawa State hereby urges the state and Federal governments to as a matter of urgency, live up to their constitutional responsibility in Akwanga Local Government Area and its environs,” the statement said.
