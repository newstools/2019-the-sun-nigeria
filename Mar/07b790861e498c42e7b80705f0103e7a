Okey Sampson, Aba Apathy trailed the governorship and House of Assembly elections in Aba, Abia State, as many polling units visited had more agents in place than voters. Voting started early in many centres, but surprisingly the turnout was shockingly far below what was recorded in the Presidential and National Assembly elections held on 23rd of February. A visit to some Polling Units (PU) in different wards in Aba South, Aba North and Osisioma Local Government Areas all within Aba, showed the figures recorded in relation to registered voters and number of votes were far below expectations. In Aba South Ward-9, PU-1, only 31 persons voted out of 158 registered voters. In PU-3 of the same ward, 77 persons voted as against 673 registered Voters. In PU-23 at Old Court (CS-Park) which has 616 registered voters, only 28 voters participated in the voting. Also in PU-24 with 934 registered voters only 82 votes were recorded. There was casualty in the city as unconfirmed report from Umuogele ward 14 in the outskirts of Aba south has it that one person was killed when some party agents and thugs hired by one of the parties engaged in fierce fighting. Voting started in the area by 2pm as materials arrived late. Most of the polling unit result sheets in the area were reported missing and this made some party agents to call for the cancellation of the election in the area. In Aba North, precisely at Abia State Polytechnic, Aba (Eziama Ward-1) PU-10 had only 129 votes out of 1,540 registered voters. PU-9 withÂ  2,301 registered voters, recorded 29 votes as well. Also PU-7 with 2,059 registered voters did not help matters as it recorded 136 votes. The case was not different and palatable at PU-5 as 147 votes were cast as against 1,890 registered voters In Osisioma LGA, precisely, at Ward-3, at PU-2, at the Abayi Post Office, number of registered voters were 2,934, but only 346 votes were recorded.
