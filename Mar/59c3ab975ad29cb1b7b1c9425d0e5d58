Isaac Anumihe, Awka The presidential audit committee at the weekend,   expressed dissatisfaction over the slow pace of work at the N3.5 billion  3.0 megawatts solar hybrid power plant located at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Anambra State,  saying that it is below 40 per cent implementation. Making this observation, the secretary of the presidential monitoring team, Idache Anthony, said that not only that the project is below 40 per cent completion, it  is behind schedule because it had nine  months  completion deadline when it was awarded in 2017. According to him, the  project has not been implemented thoroughly and  the level of implementation is not impressive. “The level of implementation compared to the time of award is not impressive. If he had given us information we would have known the percentage. But if you ask me, looking at it physically, I can say that this project is not above 40 per cent” he surmised. When he tried to find out the cause of the delay, he said, the project engineer, Charles Edeh,    could not provide information about the project. “From what we are seeing now, we cannot lift the project physically from here to Mr President to see. The information we provide about the project will form part of our findings that Mr President will use to  ascertain the level of implementation. Now that the site engineer cannot provide information for us we are handicapped,  so to speak,  about our report and what we are going back with” he said.
