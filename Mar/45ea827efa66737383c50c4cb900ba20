Godwin Tsa, Abuja The Presidential Election Tribunal will, today, commence hearing in the petition filed by the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and its  presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, against the declaration of President Muhammadu Buhari, of the All Progessive Congress (APC), by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as winner of the February 23 presidential election. The tribunal had already granted both parties permission to have access to  the materials used for the election for the purpose of inspection. Findings at the tribunal’s Secretariat, by Daily Sun, yesterday, indicated that hearing notices had been sent to all parties to the petition. Atiku and PDP had, in their separate petitions, asked  the tribunal to declare  Buhari’s election invalid by reason  of fraud, corrupt practices and manipulation of results. The petitioners contended that Buhari  was not duly elected by majority of lawful votes cast at the election as well as substantial non-compliance with the provisions of the Electoral Act, 2010 (as amended). The petitioners  also said Buhari submitted to INEC an affidavit containing false information of a fundamental nature, to aid his qualification for the said election. They further  submitted that Buhari, ‎who was declared winner, by INEC,  was not duly elected by a majority of the lawful votes cast at the said presidential election and did not score one-quarter of the lawful votes cast  in at least two-thirds of the states of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.
