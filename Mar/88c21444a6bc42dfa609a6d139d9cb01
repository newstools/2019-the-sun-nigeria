Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, has said the All Progressives Congress (APC) victory in all elective positions contested in the state in the general elections has placed a burden of performance on the party. The governor said this at the Government House Chapel, Ado Ekiti, yesterday, where a thanksgiving mass was held for the 26 House of Assembly members elected on APC platform in Saturdayâ€™s election. A similar thanksgiving was held at the chapel for the newly elected APC National Assembly members, two Sundays ago. All the newly elected 26 members of the Ekiti State House of Assembly, and the newly elected members of the national assembly, as well as chieftains of the party in the state attended the thanksgiving service. Fayemi said the APC has no excuse for non-performance now that Ekiti people have demonstrated their confidence in the party by overwhelmingly voting for the party, in the just concluded elections. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Olayinka Oyebode, the governor emphasised that he and the newly elected federal and state lawmakers are accountable to Ekiti people, for the successes and the inadequacies of the next four years.
