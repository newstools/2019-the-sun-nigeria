Obinna Odogwu, Abakaliki No fewer than 36,392 registered voters in three out of 10 wards in Ezza North Local Government Area (LGA) of Ebonyi State were disenfranchised in the governorship and House of Assembly elections in the state following an inferno that engulfed three Registration Area Centres (RACs) of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the council area. Suspected political thugs about 2:15a.m on Saturday set ablaze all the voting materials meant to be used in Oriuzo 009; Okposi Umuoghara 007 and Ekaa 002 RACs. Sunday Sun gathered that the thugs stormed the RACs and shot sporadically into the air before setting the election materials ablaze. According to sources, the ad-hoc staff of the INEC, some of who were youth corps members, scampered for safety while the ensuing confusion lasted.
