The Director of Awareness and Sensitisation of the National Movement for Re-election of Buhari (NMFRB), Prince Samuel Ojo, has expressed gratitude to Nigerians for the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari, adding that the federal government has in the last four years corrected the anomalies of previous administrations. He cautioned the political class against heating the polity with unguided and inflammatory utterances, stressing that the genuine intention of the President will always make him victorious in his endeavours. While advising the Presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar to accept the results of the presidential election in good faith, the retired deputy commissioner of Police, commended the National Coordinator of the Movement, Dr. Orji Kalu, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Comrade Adams Oshiomole  and other stakeholders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for their efforts in ensuring victory for President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo in the presidential poll. Speaking with some journalists in Abuja, yesterday, Ojo stated that the leadership of the NMFRB will embark on a “Thank You” to all the states in Nigeria as promised during its sensitization visits to all the states across the country  before the 2019 general elections. He said: “I salute the courage of our national coordinator, Dr. Orji Kalu, who took it upon himself to galvanise support for the re-election bid of president Muhammadu Buhari, by visiting all the states in Nigeria before the general elections. “While the president was on medical vacation abroad, Kalu was mocked by the opposition for making claims that president Buhari, will be full of life upon his return to Nigeria. “We are happy that, today, Kalu has been vindicated not only because the president is hale and hearty but has performed beyond expectations.”
