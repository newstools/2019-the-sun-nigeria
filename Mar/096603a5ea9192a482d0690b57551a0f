Olanrewaju Lawal, Birnin-Kebbi The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Kebbi State, has extended the service years of seven corps members by four months for violation of the scheme’s rules. The NYSC coordinator  in the state, Mr Barde Usman, confirmed their extension yesterday, in Birinin Kebbi, during the passing out ceremony of the 2018 batch A corps members in the state. “Six males and one female corps members are to repeat service by two to four months, while four males and two females corps members absconded and their next of kins have been contacted,‘’ he said. Meanwhile, discharge certificates were issued to 1,383 corp members,  out of  which 798 were male and 585 were females corps. While  charging them to be good ambassadors of the country whenever they may be, the coordinator congratulated them on the successful completion of the national service. He said the skills acquisition and vocational training they received during the orientation were enough to make them excel in the labour market. “Do not allow anyone  to take advantage of your desperation in legal immigration to outside country. Try to be good ambassadors of  this country and your family too. Please try to ensure you move with people of good character, don’t join bad company. Ensure you don’t engage in criminal activities because it is dangerous and risky.”
