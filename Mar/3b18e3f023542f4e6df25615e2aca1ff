Linus Oota, Lafia Governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Nasarawa State, David Ombugadu, has described the result of the March 9 governorship election in the state as electoral fraud and vowed to reclaim his mandate. He said that the governorship election in the state was a grand theft of the people’s will, noting that the election was the worst in the history of the state. Ombugadu, who stated this yesterday in his residence in Akwanga Local Government Area of the state during a press conference on the outcome of the election, claimed that facts and figures at his disposal showed that he won the election, stressing that he would reclaim his stolen mandate at the election petition tribunal.   His words: “From what we have seen, Nasarawa State is gradually becoming the headquarters of rigging. The facts are there; everything that is happening in Kano is what is happening in Nasarawa State. Everything that is happening in Bauchi State is what is happening in Nasarawa State. The monumental rigging that took place in the governorship election in Nasarawa State will soon be exposed by the judiciary. I have total confidence in the judiciary.  I believe that the judiciary will do justice to what has happened in Nasarawa State. The people’s mandate that was stolen will be recovered.”
