Gyang Bere, Jos A former deputy governor of Plateau State, Dame Pauline Tallen, yesterday commended the impressive turnout of voters in the governorship and state assembly elections. She gave the commendation after casting her ballot in the early hours of Saturday in Shendam Local Government Area of Plateau.    She said: “The turn out generally at first was not too impressive when I cast my vote at my polling unit at about 8:30am compare to the Presidential election. We had to reach out to the ward heads to mobilize people to come out. “The presidential election is different from governorship election. A lot of people have realized their mistakes. Plateau has no choice than to key into the government at the centre. Nigerians have unanimously accepted APC; Nigerians have faith in Mr President that was why they voted him. “Plateau is an APC state and by the grace of God we will still maintain that. I thank God now that the voters’ turnout is very impressive now.” She blamed the low turnout in the early hours on problem of water which compelled women to spend their times to fetch tap water.
