Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri At least, 47 political parties have headed to the tribunal to challenge declaration of Emeka Ihedioha by the Independent National Electoral Commission(INEC) as winner of 2019 governorship election in Imo State. Addressing newsmen, yesterday, spokesperson of the parties and Deputy National Chairman of People’s Party of Nigeria (PPN), Chinedu Ukadike, said the parties took the step to avert a wrong precedence in the state, by INEC declaring a winner of the governorship election without following the constitution. According to Ukadike, the declaration of Ihedioha as the winner of that election without scoring the constitutional two-third from 18 council areas of the state is an aberration and a mockery of the electoral constitution. While calling on INEC to withhold Ihedioha’s certificate of return pending when the matter would be resolved,  he disclosed that the 47 political parties have already started their legal battle to address what they described as a “ serious breach of the constitution. “It is an aberration to have declared Ihedioha winner. It is unbecoming and shameful, declaring him winner with three local government councils. Any candidate that must win must have two-third and wide margin,” Ukadike said.
