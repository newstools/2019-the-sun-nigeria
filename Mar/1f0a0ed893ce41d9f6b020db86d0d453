Zika Bobby Two suspects posing as Nigeria Customs Service intermediaries in the ongoing distribution of rice and other food items to orphanages have been arrested at the Seme area of Badagry. Customs Public Relations Officer, Joseph Attah, told newsmen that the suspects, a man and a woman, approached some unsuspecting orphanages on pretence of working for the service. “We discovered that some unpatriotic elements, who do not have human feelings in them have attempted to catch into this good gesture by the Federal Government to further subjugate our people, especially the suffering Nigerians into more hardship. We have discovered this man and a woman going about collecting documents from orphanages, pretending to be working for Customs. Their intention is clear, though there has not been any extortion yet,” he said. He clarified that the Service set up a committee, which is in charge of the distribution, adding that Customs has no intention of using intermediary for distribution.
