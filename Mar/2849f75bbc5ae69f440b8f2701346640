Clement Adeyi, Ibadan Osun State Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, has assured that the All Progressives Congress’ (APC) victory in the House of Assembly election held in the state last Saturday, where the party clinched majority seats ahead of the opposition, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), would galvanise rapid development agenda. The APC won 22 out of the 26 assembly seats in the election which results were declared on Sunday by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), while the PDP got three seats. One result for Oriade constituency was declared inconclusive. Oyetola said with a steady support from the House of Assembly, there would be no inhibition for the government to deliver the democracy dividends that the party promised the people during the electioneering. “Having absolute majority in the legislature will enable the government to move at the pace that will fast track the development agenda of this administration,” the governor said in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Adeniyi Adesina, yesterday, in Osogbo, the state capital. “The outcome of the House of Assembly election is a further proof of the popularity of our party in this state. It shows that nobody can describe our victory in previous elections as a fluke. “Already, we’ve launched out, on a massive scale, in road rehabilitation across major towns. The grading of critical rural roads is ongoing. “We’ve also flagged off revitalisation of nine major secondary hospitals and 332 Primary Healthcare Centres (PHCs) (one per ward), to take healthcare to our people at the grassroots. “Our big plans for agriculture and mining will come on steam soon. We are set to hold our First Economic Summit to launch the state into a boom,” Oyetola said.
