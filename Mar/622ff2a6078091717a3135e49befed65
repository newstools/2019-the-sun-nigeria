Noah Ebije, Kaduna The Programme Manager, Kaduna State Tuberculosis (TB) Control programme, Dr. Julius Gajere, has said people’s awareness about tuberculosis in Nigeria, and Kaduna State, in particular, is very low. Speaking at an advocacy visit to the state council of Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Dr. Gajere noted that people’s awareness about HIV/AID is higher than that of TB, even as the airbone disease is a serious threat to the people, particularly  in rural areas. He called on NUJ members, as, “stakeholders to help in the fight against tuberculosis in Nigeria generally and Kaduna State in particular. We will be looking at the areas your organisation could be of support in the fight to end tuberculosis in Nigeria. “We have alot of challenges in the control of tuberculosis. We are here to collaborate with you becsuse we believe that the collaboration will go a long in the control of the tuberculosis. “The tuberculosis awareness is very low; especially in the rural areas. Over 70 percent are not aware of it. They know more about HIV/AIDS than tuberculosis. The people don’t know about tuberculosis; they don’t know what to do with it, they don’t know how it occurs”. In his response, state Chairman of Kaduna NUJ, Comrade Adamu Yusuf, acknowledged that journalists have a traditional role to play in TB awareness across the country. He assured that the NUJ is ready to partner with the team; to create awareness about the disease.
