Paul Osuyi, Asaba Armed men suspected to be political thugs on Saturday stabbed the ward chairman of one of the political parties in Oleh, Isoko South Local Government Area of Delta State, Mr Vincent Egbogbo, during the governorship and House of Assembly elections. The incident happened at ward 01, unit 07, Egide Street in Oleh. A stalwart of the party in the area, who spoke on condition of anonymity, accused a rival political party of unleashing mayhem in the area. The source said: “A group of thugs were driving from one polling unit to another threatening voters that those that will not vote for their party should leave the polling centre.  So, the ward chairman told them to stop intimidating voters, which resulted in the attack.” He said the victim was taken to a hospital in the area where he was receiving treatment.
