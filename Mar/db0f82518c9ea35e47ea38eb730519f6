Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa The Bayelsa State Police Command has explained how gunmen attacked and shot two policemen on guard at Udeme Hotels, Yenagoa, last Friday night and carted away their service rifles.   Emmanuel Paulker, representing Bayelsa Central Senatorial District at the National Assembly, owns the hotel, located at DSP Alamieyeseigha road, Opolo, Yenagoa.   Eye witness accounts said the gunmen driving a Toyota Camry car drove into the car park of the hotel as guests, came down and approached the security post in a commando style and opened fire on the two policemen.
