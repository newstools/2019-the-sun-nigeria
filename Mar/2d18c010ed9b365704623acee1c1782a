Desmond Mgboh, Kano Kano State Concerned Citizens Initiative (KCCI) has canvassed the conduct of violence–free supplementary elections in the state on Saturday. The initiative led by distinguished elders from various walks of life, such as the former presidential candidate of the defunct National Republican Convention (NRC), Alhaji Bashir Tofa, said Kano State cannot afford to witness a violent poll. Speaking, yesterday, on behalf of the initiative,  Alhaji Tofa said: ”We are anxious, concerned, disturbed and troubled by the seeming discord and agitated impatience manifesting in Kano since the collation of the March 9 governorship and State House of Assembly elections. “We strongly plead that all the electoral officials must be told, in no uncertain terms, to live above board, and that any one found wanting must receive the maximum sanction provided by the Electoral Act and the Constitution. “It is also very necessary to plead with all the arms of our security architecture to remain at alert, from now on, until the formal declaration of the rerun election.” They elders also called for sufficient personnel to be deployed to each of the 234 polling units where the exercise would hold. While applauding the security agencies for an excellent job during the previous polls, they urged them to go ahead and complete their impressive performance, by being above board and completely non partisan during the conduct of the supplementary poll.
