A mild drama ensued yesterday at one of the polling units in Ilorin when an intending voter who was on her way to her polling booth fell into labour. The woman whose name could not be ascertained but was said to be in her late twenties was on the way to her polling for accreditation and voting when she fell into labour. Femi Oparinde, a journalist with SOBI 101.9FM who was on election duty, at the time rushed the lady to a nearby hospital. Oparinde said his attention was attracted by a group of voters who gathered at different spot from the lines voters. “I saw some old women trying to help a pregnant woman to deliver her baby. So, I quickly stopped them and took her to a nearby hospital and handed her over to the hospital management to handle the rest.”
