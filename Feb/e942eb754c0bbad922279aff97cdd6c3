Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) ad hoc staff, mainly its Returning and Collation Officers, as at the time of filling this report were stranded at the headquarters of the commission along Port Harcourt road. One of the officers, Amah Emecheta, who spoke to our correspondent said that they were at the commission to be posted to their various centres only to be told that only staff of the Federal University of Technology would be eventually taken. Emecheta, expressing disappointment, noted that the rest of the officers from federal institutions in the state had to abandon their predicament to fate as they have already been caught by the no-movement order of the federal government. But reacting to this INEC Public Relations Officer!Mrs Emmanuel Okpala said the ad hoc staff had no business crowding at the commissionâ€™s office, maintaining that text messages would be sent to those taken by the commission. She equally denied the allegation that the commission is only favouring those ad hoc staff from FUTO.
