Remi Adefulu All Progressives Congress (APC), National Leader, Senator Bola Tinubu yesterday commended the conduct of the presidential and National Assembly polls by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). This was even as there were reports of violence in some parts of the state including Somolu and Okota, just as there were reports of faulty card readers. Tinubu who spoke with journalists after voting at unit 047 on Sunday Adigun Street, Ikeja around 11 a,m said the APC would accept the outcome of the election as long as it is free and fair. According to him, his support for the party was without strings attached, adding that he had not collected any contract from the federal government for severals  years. He therefore urged Nigerians to disregard news about his benefitting from the government in any manner. Lagos State PDP gubernatorial candidate, Mr Jimi Agbaje, however decried the issue of faulty card readers, saying the machine could not capture his finger print and four others in yesterday’s polls. This, he reasoned could subject the machine to manipulation. He, however, expressed confidence that his party’s flag bearer in the presidential election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, would win the election. However, the Convener, Re-Elect Buhari, Movement (RBM), Mr Emmanuel Umohinyang, commended the conduct of the exercise across the country. Speaking with reporters after voting at Wasinmi Secondary School, Maryland, Lagos, he said he was highly impressed with the level of success recorded nationwide in the polls. The chairman of Mushin Local Government Area, Mr Lanre Bamigboye, who also commended the exercise tasked INEC to ensure better performance of the card readers. In the alternative, he said INEC could resort to manual accreditation in the coming polls if there is a consensus among party agents.
