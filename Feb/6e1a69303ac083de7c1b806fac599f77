Timothy Olanrewaju, Maiduguri Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Assembly candidates in Borno State have called for the cancellation of Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly elections in the state. The five candidates led by former Special Adviser to ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo on National Assembly Matters, Senator Abba Aji, who is also a candidate for Borno Central senatorial zone, said the process of the elections was violated “Election is a process and once the process is strictly followed, elections are deemed to be valid. There was violation of elections process in Borno for both presidential and National Assembly polls and this puts questions on the validity of the elections,” he said. Results collated at the INEC collation centre showed APC presidential candidate, Muhammadu Buhari leading.
