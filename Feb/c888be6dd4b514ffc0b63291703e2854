Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr has once again reiterated that no Nigeria Professional Football League player can walk into his team ahead of 2019 Africa Cup of Nations except he is exceptional. Rohr in an exclusive interview with Bunmi Blair believed the local-based players should try out the U20 and U23 teams first. It was thought that Katsina United glovesman, Ikechukwu Ezenwa is the only NPFL star that will be considered for a Super Eagles invitation ahead of the tournament in Egypt. ‘’Not for the moment, they didn’t play for six months in the League. Finally they have started, we are watching them,’’ Rohr stated. ‘’We also have the CHAN team where they can play, we have the U23 and U20 teams, the best ones, some of the U20s are playing in the League already. ‘’We will watch them, if there is a good player who deserves to come to the Super Eagles, we will see but there are also some steps before the other national teams. ‘’The U23s are playing soon against Libya, so it’s also an opportunity to see some of them and it will be very difficult to get into the Super Eagles A team because we already have so many good players. ‘’Somebody must really be on a high level to have a chance to come with us’’. Six local based players Azubuike Egwuekwe, Reuben Gabriel, Godfrey Oboabona, Ejike Uzoenyi, Sunday Mba and Chigozie Agbim were part of the Super Eagles squad, which won the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations.
