Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri Some Igbo groups, yesterday, in Owerri, the Imo State capital, said they support the decision of the Igbo separatist group, the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign States of Biafra (MASSOB) not to boycott the forthcoming elections. The groups, which include Progressive Igbo Students Forum (PISF) Igbo Gadi Nma (IGN), Progressive Igbo Youths For Good Governance (PIYGG) and Igbo Women for Progressive Change (IWPC), after an  interface meeting on protective and sustainability of Igbo political, economical and social stability in Nigeria,  resolved to stand by MASSOB on their persistence that voting should hold in the South East, as a way of edging out President Muhammadu Buhari. Giving further reasons why they are backing MASSOB, the group, through its spokesperson, Johnson Anyim, said having remembered the alleged  gruesome murder of members of the Indigenous People of Biafra  (IPOB) in Aba, Nkpor, Onitsha, Asaba, Umuahia and Nnewi, including the illegal arrest, torture and imprisonment of IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu and other IPOB leaders, by security agencies, they took their stand. The group said: “After our thorough investigation of the mindset of president Buhari and his cabals in APC, we found out that the continuation of this current administration will spell more doom for Igbo and Christians in general, in Nigeria. “We unanimously agreed and declare that Igbo will never boycott or sit at home on election days. “Boycotting the elections simply means shooting ourselves in both legs, which eventually will cease our movement temporarily. It will take Igbo politically and economically backwards.”
