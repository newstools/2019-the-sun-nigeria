THE Centre for Ant-Corruption and Open Leadership (CACOL) has called on the chairman of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, to probe the alleged corruption case against former director-general of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Mounir Haliru Gwarzo. CACOL made the call yesterday at a press conference in Ikeja, Lagos, saying President Muhammadu Buhari had, upon the centre’s petition, directed the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and the Minister of Finance to investigate the matter, which they did. Chairman of CACOL, Debo Adeniran, said that, in a strange twist, the matter was taken from the EFCC and  handed over to the ICPC, and, “rather than charging Mr. Gwarzo for two infractions based on two allegations levelled against him, the ICPC chose to bring him before to an FCT high court in Abuja for only one infraction.”
