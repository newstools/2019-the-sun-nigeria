Geoffrey Anyanwu, Awka The vice presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Peter Obi, yesterday, resumed his campaigns in major markets across Anambra State with a passionate appeal to traders to be part of the rescue mission for Nigeria. Obi urged the traders to come out en masse on Saturday and use their voters’ card to effect change in leadership of the country by voting massively for the PDP candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. Besides visiting markets, Obi visited major markets in Onitsha; Electronics Market, Ogbo Afere, Relief Market and Ogbaru Main Market. He explained to the people the imperatives of Atiku’s presidency as what Nigeria needs now to get the country working again, urging them to support the move and also get their family members and associates to be part of the move to throw away the All Progressives Congress (APC) and their bad governance. Lamenting the level of decay in the country in terms of infrastructure, absence of employment for the youth, lawlessness and recklessness in high places, mounting foreign and local debt, biting tax regime, incompetence, among others, Obi warned that any further  tolerance of the present state of affairs would see the country collapse. Taking note of the countless number of generators in one of the markets, Obi asked rhetorically: “How long will our economy be one powered by generators?” He promised that Atiku, having come out with detailed work plan, would place  the country on track again to continue her truncated democratic and  economic development.
