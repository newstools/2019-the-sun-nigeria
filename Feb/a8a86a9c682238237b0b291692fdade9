Magnus Eze, Enugu Saturday’s presidential election between President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and former vice president and candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has aggravated the brewing crisis in the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) as a faction of the party, yesterday, adopted the latter as its preferred candidate. Although APGA has a flag bearer in General John Gbor; national leader of the party and Governor of Anambra State, Chief Willie Obiano has publicly supported Buhari. Disgruntled APGA members, consisting mainly of state chapter chairmen and led by Chief Jerry Obasi, in a well-attended meeting in Enugu, said they saw the need to join forces with other progressives to rescue the country. Obasi said they were impressed by Atiku’s promise to restructure the country and make the economy work again while providing the environment for job and wealth creation. “We can’t allow APGA to be destroyed by strangers who invaded our party. Some people claim that they are the leaders of APGA, but, they are at a different place while the soul of the party is somewhere else. “I am a believer in one Nigeria and anything that will threaten the unity, I will kick against it. We all have where we came from and since our fathers in PANDEF, Ohanaeze, Middle Belt Forum and others, have taken a position, we have to strategically align,” he said. Meanwhile, former minister of state for Foreign Affairs, Chief Dubem Onyia, who accepted the letter of adoption, on behalf of Atiku, applauded them for offering to partner with Atiku.
