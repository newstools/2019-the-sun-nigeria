Managing Director/Chief Executive, Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON), Mr. Ahmed Kuru, Tuesday in Abuja, pledged the Corporation would continue to seek improved collaboration with Estate Surveyors and Valuers Registration Board of Nigeria (ESVARBON) due to the critical role they play in asset sales. Kuru, who spoke when he received a delegation from ESVARBON, led by its Chairman, Sir Nweke Umezuruike, stated that such collaboration with a sister agency was needed now in the life of AMCON given the pile up of assets, which have to be sold to meet its mandate at the end of the day. He said, â€œValuers determine a lot of what we do in terms of assets sale. We therefore consider ESVARBON as key stakeholders in our recovery mandate and will always encourage this sort of interaction. That is why I have always said that conservativeness is very key in the valuation business because it is critical to how we (AMCON) can go about the disposal of assets we have in our portfolio. We have always engaged your members and we will continue to engage them to handle our valuations and how the reports they come up with affect our decisions. So, we will continue to work with ESVARBON because your job as estate valuers have both negative and positive impact on AMCON.
