Steering Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Campaign Council, Lagos State chapter has visited the former Osun State governor, Rauf Aregbesola. This was in continuation of its efforts at securing a landslide victory for President Muhammadu Buhari and the party governorship candidate, Babajide Sanwo-Olu at the Saturday next and March 2 polls respectively. Speaking on the occasion, the state Coordinator of the committe in Lagos,  Kunle Oyewunmi, highlighted some of the major interventions of the committee in the short period of its existence, which he said include the house to house campaign and the effort of the committee in getting young and first time voters who are not necessarily card-carrying members of the APC to understand the ‘real issues’ to look out for in deciding who they should cast their votes for, beyond the misrepresentation on social media. Oyewunmi also spoke on the committee’s effort at extracting commitment for Chief Orji Uzor Kalu to lead a formidable campaign in Ndigbo dominated areas and markets to convince them to vote for the APC. He also requested Aregbesola’s support for its signature programme, the FeBUHARI Youth Road Show, scheduled for Valentine’s Day February 14. In his response, Aregbesola thanked the leadership and members of the committee for the visit and encouraged them to do more in convincing the youths to continue to support the Buhari/Osinbajo administration. He recalled how the previous administration from 1999 to 2015 created the current economic hardship and wanton insecurity in the country. He also expressed deep concern over why the People’s Democratic Party could still have the courage to shamelessly confront Nigerians and solicit for votes. He urged Nigerians to reject the PDP on all fronts as he expressed strong optimism that President Buhari and, indeed, the APC would emerge with a landslide margin in the elections. He also promised to support the FeBUHARI Youth Road Show.
