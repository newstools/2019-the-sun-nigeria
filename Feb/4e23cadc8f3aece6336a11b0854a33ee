According to the elder statesman, those candidates invited but could not attend for valid reasons would be given another opportunity on Wednesday after which the elders would choose among the invitees, whom to support for the election. “This time, it is not just having the debates; whoever we endorse, we would campaign for everywhere, in the churches, markets, parks –  everywhere. The essence is for us to be united in enthroning a good governor in our state,” Obioha said.
