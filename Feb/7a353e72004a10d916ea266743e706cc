Raphael Ede, Enugu Operatives of the Enugu State Police Command have arrested a 56-year-old woman, Edith Ewulu, for allegedly abducting a five-year-old child, Felicia Godwin, in Emene, Enugu East Local Government Area of Enugu State. A statement by the police public relations officer (PPRO), Ebere Amaraizu, said that the suspect was arrested by operatives of the Emene Division of the command in one of the new-generation churches during a thanksgiving and dedication service of the child. He said that the suspect, who hails from Enugu Agidi in Anambra State but resides in Emene suburb, was found in possession of the child, said to have been abducted while she was playing, on February 6, 2019, inside their compound in Emene. Amaraizu said that luck ran out for the suspect when police operatives, working on intelligence, swooped on the church and arrested her with the little girl whom she had renamed Gift Ewulu as her daughter. The suspect, the PPRO said, has told the operatives investigating the matter that she bought the little girl from one Chioma, who claimed to be running a social home in Aba, Abia State, at the cost of N470,000. He said the mother of the child, Philomena Godwin, had told the police that her daughter was abducted on February 6, 2019, from her compound where she was playing. Amaraizu quoted the mother as saying, “I was not feeling well and decided to have some sleep while my daughter was outside playing but, when I woke up, I couldn’t find her. After several unsuccessful searches for her whereabouts, I reported the matter to the police.
