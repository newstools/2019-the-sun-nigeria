Laide Raheem, Abeokuta African Democratic Congress (ADC) in Ogun State has described the presidential and National Assembly elections  of last Saturday as ‘just a charade’. The party equally alleged that the All Progressives Congress (APC) “did not win the poll, but rather engaged in intimidation of voters and vote-buying.” The party, which claimed further that the election was marred with irregularities, vowed it would challenge the outcome of the poll at the election tribunal, after a careful examination of the situation and gathering of sufficient evidences of electoral malfeasance. Briefing newsmen, yesterday, in Abeokuta, the Director General (DG), Gboyega Nasir Isiaka Campaign Organisation (GNICO), Anthony Ojeshina, said the party’s earlier warning that the ruling party had plans to compromise the election had been justified by the electoral fraud perpetrated by the APC.  He expressed the party’s disappointment that despite its calls on the security agencies and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to prevent manipulation of the polls, the ruling party still had its way. Ojeshina, however, carpeted the security apparatus and the INEC for standing idly and allow ‘anti-democratic forces have their way’. The GNICO DG, therefore, called on the INEC, police and other relevant agencies to ensure the irregularities do not reoccur on March 9 governorship and House of Assembly election, saying, “our party will resist the fraud that characterised the last elections in the state.”
