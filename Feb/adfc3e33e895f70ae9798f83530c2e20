Jeff Amechi Agbodo, Onitsha The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has accused the Nigerian Army of shooting and killing two of its members in Owerri, Imo State, as well as arresting many of its members including a couple in Aba, Abia State. The group alleged that the Nigerian Army was conducting a ‘stealth genocidal war against Biafrans,’ and called on the international community to take note. The Media and Publicity Secretary of IPOB, Emma Powerful, in a statement said that its decision to boycott elections was an act of civil disobedience which any reasonable person ought to understand. “The Nigerian Army is at it again. Yesterday they shot dead two young men in Owerri. Last night (Monday) and this morning they have commenced their abduction of Biafrans in Aba. Biafrans are now the longest-suffering race in human history.” READ ALSO: APC vows to sanction Amosun over Ogun presidential rally violence “One day the anger will no longer be controllable  and the world will wake up then to start pontificating. Nigerian Army is conducting a stealth genocidal war against Biafrans and it is the responsibility of the world to take note. “We have been made to feel that a Biafran life is worthless. Let these facts be chronicled for posterity because we shall reference them at the appropriate time. Any day we start, let the world not blame us. Those that gave the Nigerian Army license to kill our people will regret it, them and their families. “Nigerian Army must release those they abducted including a husband and wife they kidnapped this morning. “Our decision to boycott elections is an act of civil disobedience which any reasonable person ought to understand. That Nigeria is an uncivilised backward society is not the fault of IPOB. We have chosen a civilised, non-violent approach but it appears the Fulani Caliphate, their Jihadi Nigerian Army and Igbo efulefu are hell bent on provoking us to pick up arms.
