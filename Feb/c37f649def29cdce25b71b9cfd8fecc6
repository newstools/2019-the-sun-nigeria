Tony Udemba Wife of former vice president and presidential candidate of the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party (PDP), Mrs. Jennifer Douglas Atiku Abubakar, yesterday, stormed Lagos markets in a major push to canvass votes for her husband. Accompanied by a member of the House of Representatives, Rita Orji, representing Ajeromi Ifelodun Federal Constituency, Mrs Atiku and her campaign team visited major markets in Ajeromi Ifelodun council, including popular Boundary Market, Trinity Auto-Parts Market, Berger Auto Market and Coker/ Odunade Building Materials Market. She urged the traders to vote for all PDP candidates in order to end hunger and difficulties in the country. The duo of Atiku and Orji shared the vision of a new and progressive Nigeria, under the leadership of the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. Addressing a large crowd of traders at Coker Building Market, she berated the All Progressives Congress (APC) for failing to deliver on its promises since the party came to power in 2015.
