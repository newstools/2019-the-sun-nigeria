The International Labour Organisation (ILO) has urged member countries to build sustainable development and social justice to have lasting peace and stability. ILO Director-General Guy Ryder said in a report on Monday that many societies were scared by economic divides. “ILO will continue to be an advocate for the rights and standards that underpin decent work; the policies that foster decent work and for the conditions under which enterprises can generate decent work. “It will promote social dialogue that can build a common vision of a shared future, including a just transition to environmental sustainability,’’ Ryder said. He said that technology had generated jobs, opened up opportunities and alleviated drudgery but billions were still barely surviving in the informal economy. The ILO chief said that work chosen freely and done in conditions of equity, security and dignity could be an opportunity for better future for the people.
