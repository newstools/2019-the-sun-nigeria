A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) stalwart, Chief Charles Udeogaranya, has warned that hard times await Nigerians if they cast their votes for the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), President Muhammadu Buhari, in this weekend’s presidential elections. Conversely, he stated that a vote from PDP’s Alhaji Atiku Abubakar stands for economic recovery, regretting that the citizenry had suffered dearly at the hands of the present administration. “Every Nigerian voter who wants his or her vote to count in this weekend’s presidential election needs to know that a vote for President Muhammadu Buhari of the APC is a vote for continuity of poverty, hunger, extra-judicial killings, nepotism, economic stagnation, chronic hopelessness, reign of blame game, lamentations, ineptitude, total disrespect for the rule of law and constitutionality, abuse of power and disunity of the Nigerian people. “But a vote for Atiku Abubakar is a vote for Nigeria’s economic recovery, a more united country, hunger and poverty alleviation, creation of gainful jobs, security of lives and properties, upholding of our national institutions of governance, upholding of law, order and constitutionality. All these are aimed at making Nigeria a better nation for all Nigerians.”
