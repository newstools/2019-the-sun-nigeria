Rose Ejembi, Makurdi Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, has vowed that he would resist any attempt by the Federal government to provide special security to the leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state, Senator George Akume, during the general elections. He maintained that he wouldn’t have problems with the Federal government sending more security to the state provided the security would be for everybody irrespective of party but that if it was only for Sen. Akume, he would not allow it. The governor also promised to willingly accept defeat if the outcome of the elections genuinely does not favour him adding that the will of the people must be allowed to prevail. In a chat with newsmen on Friday in Makurdi on the preparedness of the state to participate in the forthcoming elections, Ortom who assured the people that the elections would be violent-free, urged the electorate to go out and vote for the candidates of their choice without any fear of harassment. The governor who expressed optimism that he would win the elections, however, stressed if he genuinely lost he would accept the outcome without any grouse.

I have always advised my people against violence before, during and after elections. No need for violence because development cannot take place in a chaotic atmosphere. ”But what I have continued to say is that the will of the people must be allowed to prevail. They should be allowed to vote leaders of their choice. We must be allowed to vote for peaceful existence of our dear state and country,” he said. Ortom who allayed fears that the state was not peaceful, also advised the people to vote according to their conscience, adding that they should vote only credible candidates. He expressed confidence in the ability of the Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, to ensure free, fair and credible elections. Ortom said he had got the assurance of security agencies that they would ensure that the state was secured to prevent a breakdown of law and order. function insertAfter(e,t){t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t.nextSibling)}function getElementByXPath(e,t){if(!t)t=document;if(t.evaluate)return t.evaluate(e,document,null,9,null).singleNodeValue;while(e.charAt(0)=="/")e=e.substr(1);var n=t;var r=e.split("/");for(var i=0;i<r.length;i++){var a=r[i].split(/(\w*)\[(\d*)\]/gi).filter(function(e){return!(e==""||e.match(/\s/gi))},this);var l=a[0];var o=a[1]?a[1]-1:0;if(i<r.length-1)n=n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o];else return n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o]}}if(!Array.prototype.filter){Array.prototype.filter=function(e){var t=this.length>>>0;if(typeof e!="function"){throw new TypeError}var n=[];var r=arguments[1];for(var i=0;i<t;i++){if(i in this){var a=this[i];if(e.call(r,a,i,this)){n.push(a)}}}return n}}function injectWidgetByXpath(e){var t=getElementByXPath(e);if(t==null){t=document.getElementById("tbdefault")}innerInject(t)}function injectWidgetByMarker(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);innerInject(t.parentNode)}function innerInject(e){var t=document.createElement("span");var n=document.createElement("script");var r="if JS crashes here, the first innerHTML value should be enclosed with single quotes instead of double, go to the minified version and change it";t.innerHTML="<div id='taboola-below-article'></div><div id='taboola-below-article-second'></div>";n.innerHTML="window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-c', container:'taboola-below-article', placement:'below-article', target_type: 'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-d', container:'taboola-below-article-second', placement:'below-article-2nd', target_type: 'mix'});";insertAfter(t,e);insertAfter(n,t)}injectWidgetByMarker('tbmarker');
