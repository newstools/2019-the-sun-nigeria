NAN The three state-owned tertiary institutions in Nasarawa State have commenced an indefinite strike to press home their demand for better welfare. Mr Useni Paul-Fatiye, Chairman, Joint Union of Nasarawa State Tertiary Institutions (JUNSTI), made this known in a statement made available to News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Lafia. Paul-Fatiye said that the decision to embark on the strike was taken at an emergency meeting of the union held at the College of Agriculture (COA), Lafia, on Monday. He identified the institutions involved in the action as College of Education, Akwanga, College of Agriculture, Lafia, and Nasarawa State Polytechnic, Lafia. The chairman added that the union resumed the earlier suspended strike due to the insensitivity of the government towards addressing welfare issues affecting their members. It listed some of their demands to include four years promotion arrears and failure to implement 65 years retirement age for non-teaching staff. Others are non-payment of pension arrears to retired staff since 2015, failure to implement White Paper of investigating panels, among others. He, therefore, directed all staff of the affected institutions to stay at home until the leadership of the union gives further directives. NAN recalls that the union had embarked on a similar action about a year ago over the same issues and suspended it following government promise to address the issues. However, failure by the government to keep its promise, has necessitated the current action. READ ALSO: Monarch blesses Lalong, endorses him for second term
