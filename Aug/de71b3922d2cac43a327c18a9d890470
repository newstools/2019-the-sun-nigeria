The Federal High Court in Abuja on Friday  refused the request by Shell Petroleum Development Company  directing the Minister of Petroleum Resources to renew the Oil Mineral Lease of OML11 for a period of 30 years. The Federal government  had informed the court that  its  refusal to renew the operating license of Shell Petroleum Development Company  (SPDC) was in the interest of the nation’s security. Shell had commenced legal action against the Federal government before the court seeking an order of the Court, compelling government to grant or renew its Oil Mining Lease (OML)11.
