One person lost his life while 18 others sustained injuries in a fatal motor accident along the Enugu-Onitsha expressway in Anambra State. The accident, which occurred along the Umunya-Nteje axis involved two commercial buses. A witness said one of the buses collided with an oncoming vehicle after one of its tyres pulled off while on motion. He said most of the passengers in the vehicle that had the tyre problem sustained varying degrees of injury as a result of the impact of the crash. When contacted, the Public Education Officer, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Anambra State Command, Pascal Anigbo, confirmed the incident. He said: “A head on collision by two buses this morning along the Umunya-Nteje axis of the Enugu-Onitsha expressway claimed a life and injured 18 persons. “The accident was as a result of loss of control that happened when the tyres of one of the buses pulled off, causing it to collide with the other vehicle.” He said the injured persons have been taken to a nearby hospital while the dead person has been deposited at the morgue. Anigbo regretted careless driving among motorists despite public enlightenment campaigns by the command on change of attitude towards road usage.
