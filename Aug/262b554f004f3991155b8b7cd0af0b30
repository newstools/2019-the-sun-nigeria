Chukwudi Nweje Rights activist, Chief Rita Lori-Ogbebor, has said the Itsekiri of Delta State do not have a fair deal from the Delta State Oil Producing Development Commission (DESOPADEC). Lori-Ogbebor, who spoke in Lagos, yesterday said the Itsekiri have not benefitted anything from DESOPADEC since the commission was created despite the area producing the bulk of the crude oil explored in the state. She said: “I fought hard for the creation of DESOPADEC. The reason for fighting for the commission has been defeated, there is nothing on the ground in Itsekiri to show what the commission has done for Itsekiri people, and most projects have been abandoned. The hospital at Baterea and Gbokoda are uncompleted. I still cannot imagine that Itsekiri has no potable water supply. This matter was reported to the governor last year, he promised to look into it but till now, nothing has been done.” She said though the new board inaugurated by Governor Ifeanyi Okowa last Wednesday is led by an Itsekiri son, the people will set up a committee to liaise with them to ensure the best interest of the area is served in DESOPADEC. Itsekiri sons in the board include Michael Diden, the chairman; Daniel Mayuku, executive director; and Griftson Omatsuli, as member. However, Lori-Ogbebor said the representatives need close monitoring, as they have not performed optimally in previous assignments. She charged the representatives to execute projects the people need and not “fancy projects” of their own choosing. “This point must be made clear to them. They shall account to the Itsekiri people at every point by disclosing to us how much of Itsekiri money is at their disposal and consulting with us at regular town hall meetings on how best to plough these funds for the greater good of the people. Anything short of this will be resisted. They remain and should remain trustees of our common wealth in DESOPADEC.
