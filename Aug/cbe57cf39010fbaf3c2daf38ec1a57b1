Stanley Uzoaro, Owerri  News reaching us has it that soldiers and the police have massed in front of ex-Governor Rochas Okoroacha’s Spibat residence in Owerri, the Imo State capital. It is not clear yet on whose orders the law-enforcement officers gathered at the spot.  But it might have a link with the ongoing face off between the state government and the immediate past governor over allegations bordering on pilfering of state government property.
