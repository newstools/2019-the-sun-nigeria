The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has advised candidates of the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) to always read and strictly adhere to instructions contained in the examination brochure before registering for the examinations. The board’s Head of Media and Publicity, Mr Fabian Benjamin, gave the advice in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday in Abuja. Benjamin spoke to NAN against the backdrop of concerns being raised by the public on the fate of some candidates who sat and passed the UTME with high scores, but were not sure of their plight as they did not meet the age requirement. NAN reports that one Ekele Franklin, a 15-year-old candidate, who reportedly scored the highest at the 2019 UTME, but who may not be offered admissions into University of Lagos (UNILAG), his choice of institution, because of his age, is one of such examples. According to Benjamin, the board, in its examination brochure, states the age limit for admissions into tertiary institutions in the country,but because candidates hardly read the item, fall victims to the unfortunate circumstance. ” Although universities have different requirements for entries into their institutions, where some may be stern with the age limit, others may be flexible. ” Some schools will never admit one who is not up to the required age into their institutions, even after scoring high marks in the UTME and other examinations. “It is not peculiar to Nigeria alone, it happens in other countries too,” he said. Benjamin therefore urged prospective UTME candidates to be cautious and become acquainted with, as well as follow all the instructions stated in the procedure so as not to fall into problems. He also said that admissions process for the 2019/20 would commence on Wednesday, Aug. 21, as the board was working tirelessly to ensure a smooth process. (NAN)
