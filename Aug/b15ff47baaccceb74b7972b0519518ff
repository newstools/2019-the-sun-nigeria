PSG star Neymar has been linked with both Real Madrid and Barcelona this summer, with the 27-ytear-old determined to secure a move away from the Parc des Princes. The Brazil international is unhappy living in Paris and also feels the standard of football in Ligue 1 to be too low for a player of his ability. Neymar has spent the summer sulking and PSG are determined to get him off the books. Ideally, though, Real Madrid would be the playerâ€™s next destination with relations between the Ligue 1 giants and Barcelona strained ever since the Samba star moved to the Parc des Princes in 2017. And Mundo Deportivo say PSG have already rejected a stunning offer from Real for Neymar this summer. It is claimed that, a month ago, they enquired about a deal that would see Gareth Bale head in the opposite direction.
