The Enugu Electricity Distribution PLC (EEDC), yesterday commissioned a new 11KV feeder in Abakaliki, the capital city of Ebonyi State. The newly constructed feeder, which is known as Azuiyiokwu II, has a route length of 1.3kilometers, and costs EEDC a whooping sum of N8.7 Million to execute. The Head of Communications, EEDC, Mr. Emeka Ezeh, made this known to newsmen in Enugu today. According to him, the project is in line with EEDC’s continuous effort in strengthening its network for improved service delivery and better customer experience. Ezeh said that the project was necessitated to address issues of fluctuations on voltage levels in the supply of electricity and other faults resulting to frequent downtime in some parts of the capital city. It was gathered that in Abakaliki metropolis, EEDC has four 11KV feeders serving the area which were overloaded and overstretched. These feeders are: Azuiyiokwu (main) 11KV, Township 11KV, Udemezue 11KV and Industrial 11KV. With the construction of Azuiyiokwu II, the four feeders serving the urban centres have been deloaded, thereby balancing the load on the feeders and further translating into improved and reliable power supply to customers within the area. Other network improvement projects undertaken in Ebonyi state include rehabilitation of EEDC’s portion of the Itigidi 33KV feeder up to Abaomege for improvement of supply to customers.
