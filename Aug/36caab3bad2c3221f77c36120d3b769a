The 82 Division of the Nigerian Army has dismissed Lance Cpl. Ajayi Johnson, who allegedly killed a commercial motorcyclist, Mr. Chimaobi Nwogu, at Umoukereke Ngwa in Obingwa Local Government Area of Abia State recently. The Deputy Director, Public Relations of the division, Col. Aliyu Yusuf, announced this in a statement issued in Enugu yesterday. Yusuf stated that Johnson had been handed over to the police command in Abia for prosecution. It would be recalled that the suspect had on August 7, 2019, allegedly shot Nwogu for reportedly failing to drop N100 at a military checkpoint, killing him on the spot. The army later arrested him and according to Yusuf, he was tried in accordance with the extant rules and regulations of the Nigerian Army. Yusuf said that Johnson had been dully charged, tried and reduced to the rank of a private, before he was subsequently dismissed from service. “He is, hereby, formally handed over to the Nigerian Police Force, Abia State Command today, August 21, 2019, for further necessary action. “The 82 Division will not condone any act of lawlessness and unprofessional conduct from any of its personnel, and wherever that happens, decisive action will surely be taken against such errant personnel,” he further stated. He stated that the Army would continue to discharge its core mandate of protecting lives and property of all Nigerians as provided in the Constitution.
