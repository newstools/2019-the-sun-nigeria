Ndubuisi Orji,  Abuja The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has charged the hierarchy of the Army, Police and the Department of State Services (DSS) to speak out on the abduction of its chairman  in Okene Local Government Area  of Kogi  State, Musa Adelabu, by gunmen . The PDP in a statement  by its National  Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, yesterday,  expressed  concern that three days after Adelabu’s abductors reportedly told  his family members that they were “acting on orders from above” his  whereabouts is still  unknown. The opposition  party  expressed  dismay  that in spite  its outcry  and that of family  members  of the abducted  Okene  PDP chairman,  the security agencies  were yet to speak  out on the issue. “Already, there is an ominous tension in Kogi state following intelligence reports filtering into the public domain that our LG Chairman is being tortured by his captors in a secret facility where his life is now in great danger. “Such provocative situation is capable of sparking off serious crisis in Kogi state, which location as gateway and convergence state, means a lot of dire consequences for our nation, in the event of any disturbances in the area. “It is therefore completely unacceptable that the security high command is not forthcoming with concrete statement or decisive action to secure his release despite calls by our party and the people of Kogi state,” the PDP stated.
