What I can’t confirm to you is whether the suspect is a politician,” the police spokeswoman said. Daily Sun learnt that the three suspects were arrested as part of ongoing investigation into the death of the woman, who has been identified by authorities as “Abina”. Sources tell Daily Sun that the politician was allegedly arrested in Abuja by a police team from the Sapele Area Command. The politician was said to have led the police to Benin City, the Edo State capital, where two other suspects, a mechanic and his girlfriend, were arrested. According to a security source: “We got him through his phone number that took us to Abuja where we apprehended him, and from there we brought him back to Delta. “The politician is currently helping us with investigation towards unraveling the true cause of the incident. We are detaining him at the Sapele Area Command, and we shall transfer the case to Asaba (State Police Command) once we are done for prosecution.”
