Romanus Ugwu, Abuja The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has relieved Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Frankland Briyai, of all his duties as Cross River State REC. Expressing their disappointment in a statement signed by the National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, the commission announced that it has not received his resignation letter and frowned at his use of the electoral umpire’s office in the state to announce his intention to join politics. “While it is the right of any commissioner or official of the Commission to resign his or her appointment and join any political party of his/her choice and to aspire for any office or position, INEC frowns at the use of its premises or facilities for any political purpose as this is unlawful and contrary to the Code of Conduct subscribed to by all its officials,” part of it read. “Following his declaration, the Commission has relieved Dr. Briyai of his duties as a Resident Electoral Commissioner and withdrawn all powers delegated to him. Consequently, the Administrative Secretary of Cross River State has been directed to oversee the office and take over the functions and duties of the REC until further notice.”
