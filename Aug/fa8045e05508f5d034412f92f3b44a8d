Frank Lampard began his tenure as Chelsea boss in the worse possible way with a 4-0 defeat at the hands of Manchester United at Old Trafford. Chelsea let the game slip away in dramatic fashion in the second half, conceding three goals in the final 25 minutes. The game was Lampard’s first competitive match this season and his debut as Chelsea boss after being handed the job during the summer, despite his limited managerial experience. The loss is the heaviest suffered by a new Blues manager in Chelsea’s Premier League history. It is the biggest defeat for a Chelsea manager in his first game in charge since Danny Blanchflower lost 7-2 to Middlesbrough in December 1978. Lampard signed a three-year contract and has been unable to sign any new players due to a transfer ban.Marcus. For United, it is the perfect start to their campaign and their biggest win over Chelsea in a top-flight match for 54 years. Rashford scored a double, one from the penalty spot, with Anthony Martial and summer signing Daniel James also on the scoresheet for United. Lampard was disappointed with the result, but insisted his side did not deserve to suffer such a humiliating loss. ‘It was nowhere near a 4-0,’ he said after the game. ‘Four mistakes for the goals, but we controlled major parts of the first half.”
