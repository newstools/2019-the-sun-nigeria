We have them on the Island and the Mainland. “we will have a centre each in Benin, Asaba and Uyo.Kaduna has been under consderatio for some time but some of the events of the last few days , including the problem we had at the Aiteo Cup final have stepped down consideration for Kaduna at this inspection but we have continued with the work to upgrade facilities in Kaduna with the hope that we will visit the state at the next inspection. Illo went further to explain that popularity of women football in the areas concerned , as well as the availability of basic facilities and support from the state governments are key to the project. “We have had about seven or eight things to consider, the ability to fill the stadium and whether the area is market savvy , the convenience of providing and managing a compact event for FIFA  are the key points we put into consideration before deciding on the venues. “FIFA has a standard. We  had to submit a bid document 968 pages long and we made a lot of work both in substance and in academics. “FIFA went through everything before deciding that Nigeria has a competent bid  and that we qualified for  for an inspection like this.
