Armed with a BSc in Communication, another degree in Adult and Community Education, and Diploma in Law among others, Ogedegbe’s Orange magazine hit the newsstands over a decade ago and still counting. Commenting on what inspires her, Ogedegbe said: “I love what I do. I also want to know as much as possible about the people, projects and customers I work with. I always explore new opportunities when they present themselves. I have never stopped learning. I won’t accept the status quo and I’ll never stop thinking about how to do things in new and different ways.”
