The governor, who was represented by his deputy, Mr Kayode Alabi, said, “I wish to assure you all that government is engaging the situation with all the resources at its disposal.” Abdulrazaq,  who called on religious bodies to play a crucial role in drawing men back to God, prayed for government at all levels to succeed in all their endeavours.
