Godwin Tsa, Abuja The Abuja division of the Federal High Court has given the Department of State Security Service (DSS) the go ahead to detain the convener of #RevolutionNow protests, Omoyele Sowore for 45 days pending the conclusion of its investigation. Although the DSS had sought for 90 days within which to detain Sowore, Justice Taiwo Taiwo  held that the 45 days period granted by the court is subject for renewal for further number of days after the expiration of the initial period. He said he would, therefore, be failing in his duty not to grant the request for a detention order. Justice Taiwo, said he had to grant the application, “only to the extent” of allowing the security agency to keep the respondent in custody for only 45 days for the applicant to conclude its investigation.”
