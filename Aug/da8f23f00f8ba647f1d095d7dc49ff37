Raheem Sterling has reportedly been offered a lucrative boot deal to be the new face of Air Jordan football boots. The Telegraph report that the Man City and England forward is mulling over an agreement worth £100 million. Air Jordan operate under the umbrella of the Nike corporation and have never previously marketed football boots. Sterling’s current boot deal with Nike is due to expire in a years time and the sportswear brand are keen to cash in on the stars commercial value. The 24-year-old has shot to prominence for his off-field conduct as much as his performances on it, after speaking out against racism in the sport last season. Nike dedicated a whole campaign to Sterling following his comments on the media portrayal of black athletes in the light of him being racially abused in a match at Stamford Bridge. The campaign was similar to that of American footballer Colin Kaepernick who has used his career in the NFL to publicly protest against the killing of young black men in the United States. Air Jordan only moved into football a year ago with branding on the kit of Paris Saint Germain, but now want Sterling as poster-boy for what would be one of the most lucrative boot deals ever. The brand was founded for NBA basketball star Michael Jordan, who is one of the all-time richest sporting athletes, largely from his commercial income.
