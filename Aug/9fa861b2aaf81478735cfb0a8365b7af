The Nigeria Football Federation has disclosed that its lawyers have started to review the decision against former Nigeria international and coach, Samson Siasia, by the FIFA Ethics Committee, which last Friday announced that it had placed a life ban from all football-related activities on him. Acting President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Barrister Seyi Akinwunmi, a lawyer of more than three decades at the bar, said, yesterday, that the federation had already reached out to the former U20, U23 and Super Eagles’ head coach and is aware that he is receiving appropriate legal advice. “The NFF was shocked to learn of the investigation and subsequent decision by the FIFA Ethics Committee (Adjudicatory Chamber), placing a life ban on Mr. Samson Siasia. But, we have now received documents, including one known as the Motivated Decision, and we have handed them to our lawyers to study and provide legal advice to the Federation. “It is a massive sanction on one of our legends. Siasia is a football legend, but, most importantly, he is a Nigerian. We must, therefore, be interested in the matter and be properly advised.” Akinwunmi added: “Siasia gave his all for Nigeria, playing for the U20 team right from his secondary school days and, then, for the senior team for several years, and also coaching the U20 and U23 teams and the Super Eagles. While we respect the FIFA processes and appreciate that an investigation was conducted prior to the decision, the least we, as a federation, can do is empathise with him at this time, make ourselves available to him and hope that in some way he is able to clear his name as he has promised to do.”
