 The flood, is fast becoming a perennial disaster waiting to happen as families affected last year who are just trying to recover from the previous shock are in for another experience yet again.   Another victim, Larai Tanimu who is also taking refuge in a school has called on the government to intervene. “We have left everything at home because I can only carry my children. And now I don’t have anything to give them they are crying. Please help us.” The state Deputy Governor, Alhaji Umar Namadi who visited the area on Friday said the government is doing its best to bring emergency assistance to the victims. According to the deputy governor, part: of the strategy the state will adopt to prevent the yearly occurrence of the disaster is to relocate some of the entire communities to areas that are not prone to flooding.
