Reuters/NAN) A U.S. agreement to set up a safe zone in northern Syria, a close ally of Iran, is “provocative and worrisome”, the Iranian Foreign Ministry was reported to have said by the semi-official Fars news agency. The U.S. and Turkey last week agreed to set up a joint operations centre for a proposed zone along Syria’s northeast border. “Foreign Ministry spokesman, Abbas Mousavi, said the recent announcements and agreements by American officials about creating a safe zone in northern Syria are provocative and worrisome,” Fars reported.
