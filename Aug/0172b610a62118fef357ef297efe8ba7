However, Mr Adegbite Adeniyi, Counsel to Abbo told the court that his client was sick. ”My Lord my client is suffering from Acute Febrile (medical term used to describe a sudden fever or elevation in body temperature)”, he said. Adeniyi, who presented a medical report to the court, added that Abbo was on admission in a hospital in Yola, Adamawa. He told the court that his client’s surety was in court.
