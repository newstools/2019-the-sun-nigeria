Abdullahi Bello, majority leader of the house, read a petition against Achuba at plenary, yesterday. He said signatures of 21 of the 25 lawmakers have been collected for the impeachment. The member who represents Ajaokuta constituency,Â cited section 188 of 1999 constitution and thereafter prayed the house to commence investigation ahead of the impeachment of the deputy governor. Kolawole Matthew, speaker of the house of assembly, agreed to the prayers in the petition and asked that impeachment notice be served on the deputy governor.
