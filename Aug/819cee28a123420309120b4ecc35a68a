PAUL OMOKUVIE, Bauchi  Bauchi State governor, Bala Mohammed has raised the alarm that the National Chairman of the All Progressive Congress (APC) Comrade Adams Oshiomole poses a threat to the political stability of the state owing to his undue meddling in the affairs of the state Assembly.  The governor was reacting to the courtesy call by eight of the 17 newly- inaugurated members of the state Assembly led by the APC National Chairman to the Presidential Villa, Abuja where they met President Muhammadu Buhari.  Mohammed spoke in a press statement issued by his spokesman, Dr Ladan Salihu, on Thursday.  According to the statement, “the government notes that while stakeholders refer to Mr President and update him are normal, we must dignify his office with the correct information and true position of things.  “The eight members led by the APC national chairman were part of the 17 who were sworn in last week on the floor of the Assembly. All the 31 legislators are now members of one state Assembly.  “The media is awash with the video, audio and print materials that captured the swearing-in ceremony.  “Governor appreciates the pronouncement of the president to deal with the issue in line with the constitution because he is a president for all.  “What is clear is that our president was shortchanged with the relevant information by those who led the group for their personal interests and primordial dispositions.  “As far as the government and people of Bauchi State are concerned, the enforced disharmony is now history. Bauchi legislature is one united family. The issue of another proclamation is ludicrous.  “It is clear that our legislators are not the problem, neither is the APC. Mr Oshionmole is the problem. He is a clear and present danger to the political stability in Bauchi State. This explains why he excluded members of Edo State Assembly from the visit to the Villa.  “The APC chairman should rethink his strategy as it is dead on arrival because he is dealing with political paper-tigers who were roundly defeated and soundly rejected by our people.” function insertAfter(e,t){t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t.nextSibling)}function getElementByXPath(e,t){if(!t)t=document;if(t.evaluate)return t.evaluate(e,document,null,9,null).singleNodeValue;while(e.charAt(0)=="/")e=e.substr(1);var n=t;var r=e.split("/");for(var i=0;i<r.length;i++){var a=r[i].split(/(\w*)\[(\d*)\]/gi).filter(function(e){return!(e==""||e.match(/\s/gi))},this);var l=a[0];var o=a[1]?a[1]-1:0;if(i<r.length-1)n=n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o];else return n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o]}}if(!Array.prototype.filter){Array.prototype.filter=function(e){var t=this.length>>>0;if(typeof e!="function"){throw new TypeError}var n=[];var r=arguments[1];for(var i=0;i<t;i++){if(i in this){var a=this[i];if(e.call(r,a,i,this)){n.push(a)}}}return n}}function injectWidgetByXpath(e){var t=getElementByXPath(e);if(t==null){t=document.getElementById("tbdefault")}innerInject(t)}function injectWidgetByMarker(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);innerInject(t.parentNode)}function innerInject(e){var t=document.createElement("span");var n=document.createElement("script");var r="if JS crashes here, the first innerHTML value should be enclosed with single quotes instead of double, go to the minified version and change it";t.innerHTML="<div id='taboola-below-article'></div><div id='taboola-below-article-second'></div>";n.innerHTML="window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-c', container:'taboola-below-article', placement:'below-article', target_type: 'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-d', container:'taboola-below-article-second', placement:'below-article-2nd', target_type: 'mix'});";insertAfter(t,e);insertAfter(n,t)}injectWidgetByMarker('tbmarker');
