My erudite scholar, good afternoon, sir. On Wednesday, July 24, 2019, when you mentioned Prof. Onabamiro, the parasitologist, I remembered polycyclops Onabamiroiid, the crustacian that harbours guinea worm larva before it goes into man. Happy birthday to the Asagba. – Okey Ezechukwu, medical laboratory scientist, Abatete Anambra State, 08035617260 Please, sir, won’t the RUGA herdsmen be issued certificate of occupancy!? Certainly! Then an emirate is authorised and established. With their lawlessness, would they even respect boundaries. Southern Nigeria was finished long ago. – Amakiree, 07035390254 Last card, just to hail, commend you for your article: IHEDIOHA, ROLE OF ENGR. EMMA IWUANYANWU, published in Daily Sun, Wednesday, June 12, 2019. Very thought-provoking missive,  Kudos! Dazza. – 09033330300 Please, sir, how much is the registration? I want to join you people in the football academy. God bless you. – 08120437463 Uncle Emma, I always take delight in reading your articles in The Sun every Wednesday. You are indeed a shining star for the Igbo race. Your exposition on Chief Iwuanyanuwu and Zik was alluring and educative. I read one of  your books, JEWS OF AFRICA, and marvelled at your intellectual display of historical facts therein. Sir, do a special write-up educating my Anioma brethren on the futility of disclaiming their Igboness because their tribe shall remain  Igbo, not Yoruba or Hausa. A Kwara man is proud of his Yorubaness. Remain blessed. – Barr. Peterclever Asia, Lagos, 08035034377 I want to thank you very much for continuing to expose the horrifying  events of July 29, 1996, and its aftermath, in spite of delibrate whitewashing by our government. I would like to buy your book on this shameful episode of betrayal and murder of innocent fellow citizens. – Odi Nwosu, 07083794764 PROF, again, my heart bleeds. The professional exposition of these truths you reveal leaves no room to doubt the the greatest mistake the Igbo made was to go back after the genocide to their butchers in deceitful  disguise of the so called 3Rs. I hope our folks read you on the true history of how the Igbo became endangered species till this day within the Nigerian union since 1966. – Dr. Chiejine, Okigwe, Imo State FROM CHRISTIAN CHUKWU EMMA, you are cordially invited to my thankgiving/outing service at St. Phillip Anglican Church, Obe, Nkanu west LGA, Enugu State, by 9:00am, on Sunday, August 4, 2019. Emma, the mention in your Daily Sun column of Wednesday, July 17, 2019, page 32, that the erudite Asagba of Asaba, Prof. Chike Edozien, was “Strong,  resurgent…” at age 90, gladdened my heart. I am one of the numerous admirers of His Royal Majesty. His carriage is ennobling. I wish him many more happy years on earth. – Dennis Iheanacho
