Molly Kilete, Abuja Following disagreement over medical personnel to attend to him, leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), Sheikh Ibraheem El-Zakzaky, has left India for Nigeria without treatment.
The Shiite leader departed New Dehli, India by 5pm and is expected to touch down at the Nnamdi Azikiiwe
International Airport, Abuja before 2am.
Revealing this development, President of the media forum of IMN, Ibrahim Musa, in a statement, said El-Zakzaky decided to leave the Indian hospital after what he described as the federal government’s interference on the medical procedures.
Musa said: “Following lack of breakthrough in the impasse that ensued in the treatment in New Delhi of Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky, it is now confirmed that the Sheikh is on his way back to Abuja, Nigeria. “In a video message sent through his office, the Sheikh said it was decided that they will be taken to the airport to be flown back to Nigeria. He has left Delhi by 17:00 Nigerian time. “He prayed that may that be the best option in the circumstances. “The Nigerian government’s interference and scuttling of the whole process rather than supervision as ordered by the court is the direct cause of the impasse. The government never wanted the medical leave in the first place, and did whatever to stop it by all means possible”.
