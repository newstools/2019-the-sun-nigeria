Striker Asisat Oshoala was on target and also assisted one as Barcelona Femeni thrashed CE Seagull 5-1 in the Copacat semi-final on Thursday. Oshoala, the former African Footballer of the year, has been on an impressive form all through the preseason and was a constant thorn in the flesh of CE Seagull. The attacker picked up a knock in their final pre-season game, and was substituted late on, but his goal yesterday has further confirmed her fitness status. She will be available for Nigeria√≠s trip to Algeria as the Falcons continue their quest for a Tokyo 2020 Olympic games ticket.
