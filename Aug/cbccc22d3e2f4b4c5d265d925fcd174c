 Joe Effiong, Uyo Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has identified one William Ndarake, a witness to the APC governorship candidate, Mr Nsima Ekere,  at the ongoing governorship election tribunal, as a fake employee of the commission. The said Ndaraka had earlier appeared for Ekere  as PW 44, in which he presented a video of election rigging purported to have taken place in the house of Sen Christopher Ekpenyong, the senator representing Ikot Ekpene senatorial district.  He had also told the tribunal that he was kidnapped as an INEC adhoc staff to the premises but he managed to record the said video. But an INEC staff,  Mr Ikpong Joseph Inyang, told the tribunal that William Ndarake, who was the petitioner’s 44th witness was an impostor. Testifying as a subpoenaed witness for the first respondent, Governor Udom Emmanuel Inyang, who was the supervising presiding officer of ward 4, presented the list of presiding officers, supervisory presiding officers, and polling unit booklets, and said Ndarake, who claimed to be an INEC adhoc staff, was not on any of the lists as an adhoc staff in the elections. But the Mr Joseph Inyang revealed that the said Ndarake and another man he claimed was a presiding officer in the video for Unit 004, Ward 4 in Obot Akara were both impostors. While being cross examined by counsel to the PDP, Uko Udom, SAN, the witness said the man Ndarake identified as presiding officer in the video, was also an impostor because the presiding officer for that unit was a female national youth service corps member, named Ifeanyinwa Priscilla Ifeanyi. Witness also identified Exhibit RSA564 as the result for Unit 004, which Ifeanyinwa signed as presiding officer. He added that he was given the list of all the officials for Obot Akara Local government Area and he took attendance as the Supervisory Presiding Officer in Ward 4. Earlier, a digital forensic expert, Edidiong Udoh, had described the video evidence tendered by the petitioners’ 44th Witness, Mr. William Ndarake, as a scam stage managed to mislead the tribunal. Udoh, harped his argument on the fact that the GPS was switched off on the video recording device by the producer of the video to prevent analysts from tracing the location of the event in the video. He said contrary to Mr. Ndarake’s evidence that the video was recorded under duress with the phone placed on the ground, the video showed scenes recorded by more than one person with the participants fully showing indications of being part of the plot. “If the phone was placed on the floor, the only angle it would have captured would have been only one point on the roof of the building or one direction of the room, but the video shows activities of what happened even on top of the table and all angles of the room, meaning the device was in motion from the beginning to the end.” Under cross examination by counsel to INEC, Sylva Ogwemoh SAN, he said: “From my observation, over three persons were involved in the making of this video apart from PW44. “PW44 also misled the tribunal by saying he later picked up the phone to continue the recording. All through the video, he was seen seated with legs stretched out and his hands on his thighs. This means the video was done by someone else. “The person in front of the green table and the person who begged that his face should not be recorded were in the know of the video recording. “There was someone who was doing the thumb printing. It was stage managed and not done under tension or anxiety like PW44 claimed” the forensic expert told the tribunal. function insertAfter(e,t){t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t.nextSibling)}function getElementByXPath(e,t){if(!t)t=document;if(t.evaluate)return t.evaluate(e,document,null,9,null).singleNodeValue;while(e.charAt(0)=="/")e=e.substr(1);var n=t;var r=e.split("/");for(var i=0;i<r.length;i++){var a=r[i].split(/(\w*)\[(\d*)\]/gi).filter(function(e){return!(e==""||e.match(/\s/gi))},this);var l=a[0];var o=a[1]?a[1]-1:0;if(i<r.length-1)n=n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o];else return n.getElementsByTagName(l)[o]}}if(!Array.prototype.filter){Array.prototype.filter=function(e){var t=this.length>>>0;if(typeof e!="function"){throw new TypeError}var n=[];var r=arguments[1];for(var i=0;i<t;i++){if(i in this){var a=this[i];if(e.call(r,a,i,this)){n.push(a)}}}return n}}function injectWidgetByXpath(e){var t=getElementByXPath(e);if(t==null){t=document.getElementById("tbdefault")}innerInject(t)}function injectWidgetByMarker(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);innerInject(t.parentNode)}function innerInject(e){var t=document.createElement("span");var n=document.createElement("script");var r="if JS crashes here, the first innerHTML value should be enclosed with single quotes instead of double, go to the minified version and change it";t.innerHTML="<div id='taboola-below-article'></div><div id='taboola-below-article-second'></div>";n.innerHTML="window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-c', container:'taboola-below-article', placement:'below-article', target_type: 'mix'});window._taboola = window._taboola || [];_taboola.push({mode:'thumbnails-d', container:'taboola-below-article-second', placement:'below-article-2nd', target_type: 'mix'});";insertAfter(t,e);insertAfter(n,t)}injectWidgetByMarker('tbmarker');
