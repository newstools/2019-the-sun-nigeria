Asisat Oshoala punished Arsenal, scoring a brace in a 5-2 pre-season win on Wednesday at Meadow Park, London. Oshoala, who had played for a season with the FA WSL side, has been in scintillating form in pre-season and has now netted three times in two matches for Barcelona. On Wednesday, the Nigeria international struck in the 45th and 50th minutes to extend Barcelonaâ€™s lead after initially going behind and leveling up. The striker was replaced just past the hour mark, with more minutes under her belt ahead of the new season in Spain.
