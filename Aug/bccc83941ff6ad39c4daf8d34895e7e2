Daily Sun gathered that Pastor Joseph Nwachueze, from Anambra State, was chased to his death by Chinese security operatives over immigration formalities. Sources said the Chinese security personnel, in an attempt to capturing the fleeing Nigerian pastor, used a security gadget that illuminates light on him, in order to demobilse him. It was gathered that the security gadget made the pastors numb, leading to his fall, which eventually led to his death.
