Upon the reading of the charge to the former INEC boss, he pleaded not guilty to all the counts. Following his not-guilty plea, the prosecutor, Rotimi Oyedepo, asked the court for a trial date, while also urging the court to remand the defendant in prison custody, pending the hearing of his bail application. Responding, Iwu’s lawyer, Ahmed Raji (SAN), informed the court that he had two applications, one challenging the court jurisdiction and other one for the bail application of the accused. Raji, however, withdrew the application challenging court’s jurisdiction on the grounds of his client’s freedom and urged the court to hear the bail application. Upon his withdrawal of application challenging court’s jurisdiction, Justice Obiozor, instantly struck it out. Following the striking of the application challenging court’s jurisdiction, Raji informed the court that the bail application had been served on the prosecution but yet to be responded to. He urged the court either to let his client be with the prosecution till tomorrow, Friday, or be release to him, as he undertook to personally produce him in court. He informed the court that ever since his client had been admitted to administrative bail, he has never defaulted. However, the prosecutor, Oyedepo, told the court that the appropriate place to remand a defendant after plea was taken in the prison. In his ruling, Justice Obiozor ordered that the defendant be remanded in EFCC custody till Friday, for the hearing of his bail application.
