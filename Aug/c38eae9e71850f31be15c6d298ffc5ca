Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa Ahead of the forthcoming People’s Democratic Party(PDP) gubernatorial primaries in Bayelsa State, the campaign organisation of Bayelsa Deputy Governor, Gboribiogha John Jonah (GJJ) has declared that the exercise will determine the fate of the party in the state. The publicity secretary of GJJ , Mr Markson Fefegha in a statement issued in Yenagoa, appealed to delegates of the party to vote according to their conscience and think more of the corporate interest of the State rather than individual gains. According to him delegates should realise that what is at stake is the future of Bayelsa State. He said it is a unique privilege on the part of the delegates to be part of the process that will lead to the eventual emergence of a new Bayelsa and the ushering in of unprecedented development. “It is obvious that the coming September 3 primary election of the Party will either make or break the PDP, depending on how credible and transparent the entire process will be as we already noted with dismay that the recent Ward elections to select the ad-hoc delegates was a sham and orchestrated to favour a particular aspirant, when the leadership of the party in the State ought to be neutral,” he said. Fefegha explained that Jonah, having served Governor Seriake Dickson for almost eight years, is better placed than any other aspirant to further push the laudable developmental objectives of the Restoration Administration. The statement further stated that Admiral Gboribiogha John Jonah had served in the Nigerian Navy and rose to the pinnacle of his career, thereby acquiring cognitive experience and exposure which had prepared him for greater service in the State. “As deputy governor, he has been one of the key pillars of Dickson’s Administration as well as the stabilizing factor of the Administration, given his wonderful human relations and kind disposition and willingness to listen to people. We strongly believe that the obvious lapses observed during the Ward Congresses must be avoided and corrected if the desired intention of the Party which is to have a popular and acceptable candidate to enable it win the November 16 general election is to be achieved.”
