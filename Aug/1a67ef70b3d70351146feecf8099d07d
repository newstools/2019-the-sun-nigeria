A 16-year-old girl (names withheld), allegedly raped by a popular Islamic cleric, Habeebullah Titilope Abdulrahman in Ede, Osun State has bowed to pressure from her family to forgive the cleric. The rape victim who lost her father at a very tender age had on August 2, at the Osun State Magistrate’s Court, Ede vowed to commit suicide if  her late father’s relatives went ahead to accept the offer from the cleric to settle the matter out of court. In order to show how serious she was on threat to commit suicide, on Saturday, August 3 when she could no longer bear the pressure being mounted on her by her family, she absconded from home but was later found in the morning of Sunday, August 4.
