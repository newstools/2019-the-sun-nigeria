The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) is raiding the Epe, Lagos residence of the former governor of Lagos State, Akinwunmi Ambode, and that of his Chief of Staff. Acting spokesman of the Commission Tony Orilade said the raid is in line with an ongoing investigation of the former governor and his administration. Ambode held sway in Lagos between 2015 and May 29, 2019. He is being investigated for alleged N9.9 billion linked to him. EFCC recently prayed the Federal High Court, Lagos division, to freeze the account where the N9.9 billion is lodged pending the conclusion of investigation and possible prosecution of Adewale Adesanya, the Permanent Secretary in the Office of the Chief of Staff to Ambode.
