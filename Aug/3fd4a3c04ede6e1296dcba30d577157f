Speaking while receiving the heads of the agencies in Abuja, Mohammed said the destiny of the country was in the heads of the parastatals under the Ministry of Information and Culture. He urged the heads of parastatals to use their platforms not just for the promotion of unity in the country, but harmonious relations among all groups, irrespective of ethnicity or religion. “You all have very powerful platforms to douse down the tension of disunity and I think you have the responsibility, not only to Mr. President and this nation, but also to generations unborn to use your powerful platforms to restore unity back into the country. “You should use your platforms to promote not just unity, but also cordial relations among all groups, irrespective of ethnicity or religion,” Mohammed said. Leader of the delegation and Director General of the National Orientation Agency, Garba Abari, said the heads of the parastatals were in Mohammed’s office to felicitate with him on his re-appointment and to commit themselves to carrying out the mandate of their respective agencies.
