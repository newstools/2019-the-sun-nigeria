United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc, and the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), are partnering to organise the 2019 edition of the Lagos International Trade Fair. The Fair, which holds between November 1 – 10, 2019, is the 33rd edition and is expected to provide an avenue for networking and other business opportunities that will assist to catapult business activities in Africa’s largest and busiest city, Lagos and in Nigeria. UBA, which is the headline partner will be working together with LCCI, to provide a veritable platform intended to grow both domestic and international trade. It further presents participants and visitors with opportunities to seal medium and top business deals. In line with UBA’s unflinching support to the growth of small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the bank will be giving a 20% discount to its Small and Medium business customers who register to attend the fair. UBA’s Group Head, Marketing, Mrs Dupe Olusola, who expressed excitement at the partnership, noted that the bank, with its extensive spread across Africa and other major economies of the world, is always on the lookout for partnership opportunities that will benefit the business environment and the economies where it operates.
